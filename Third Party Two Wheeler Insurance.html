<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Long-term Third Party Bike Insurance - A Road Ahead</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Long –term <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/motor-insurance/two-wheeler-insurance/">two wheeler insurance</a> can be proved as a positive move as out of the 18 cr. total registered vehicles in India, only 6 cr. are insured. One of the main reasons is many forget to renew the policy on time. The new rule is believed to benefit the entire ecosystem. It will offer price stability as the users need not pay the premiums annually. Most importantly, with this policy, one can avoid the annual hike in premiums as it is set for a period of five years. However, there is a huge difference in the premium earlier and now. It significantly raises the third party bike insurance rate. The below rates are applicable with effect from 28 August 2018:</p>

                    <p>Third Party bike insurance is a policy that offers insurance protection in case of liability arising out of accidental damage, injury or death to a third party. The insurance company bears the liabilities of the insured person. The compensation is based on the court decision; however, in case of property damage, the claimable amount is up to 7.5 lakh. Death compensation is equal to the policy sum insured.</p>                </div>

<p>3. <strong>Roadside Assistance:</strong> in case of vehicle breakdown in the middle of a journey, road-side assistance can be availed. The services like repair of a flat tyre, refilling of fuel, towing of the vehicle etc. are arranged by the network garage.</p>
<p>4. <strong>NCB Protector:</strong> NCB is a bonus offered for not claiming your policy, which ranges from 20%-50%. But in case of a claim, the NCB turns to zero. With this add-on, you can protect the accumulated NCB even in case of a claim.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Personal Accident Cover for Pillion Rider:</strong> With this cover, passengers can be covered in case of an accident. Compensation to the pillion is offered in case of an accident leading to disability or death.</p>

                    <p>You can cancel your policy anytime if you feel the coverage insufficient. However, very few are aware of the fact that the cover can be dissolved during the policy period as well. However, the cancellation may come with certain conditions:</p>
<p>1. The policy can be cancelled only if there is no claim made during the policy term</p>
<p>2. The owner should arrange for an alternate coverage, at least the basic third party bike insurance, before ceasing the exciting policy</p>
<p>3. In case of ownership transfer, the current policy can&rsquo;t be cancelled until you have an alternate cover and provide the evidence for the same</p>
<p>Bike insurance cancellation process includes:</p>
<p>1. Inform the insurance provider and register your request. You can call on their helpline number or write on the official ID</p>
<p>2. The insurance executive will guide you through the process.</p>
<p>3. In case you have bought a policy from another insurer, provide the documentary evidence for the same. You may be asked for other related paperwork to complete</p>
<p>4. The insurer will cancel the policy after receiving every minute details and verifying the documents. The premiums will be returned after deducting a small amount on a pro-rata base.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Simply put, depreciation refers to the decrease in the value of the vehicle due to normal wear and tear and age. A regular bike insurance policy doesn&rsquo;t cover the repair expenses of the parts that are prone to depreciation. If you want to avail the full value of your vehicle in case of a claim, you should buy a Zero Depreciation cover. The policy covers bike parts such as rubber, fibreglass, nylon and plastic parts. Usually, one can claim twice in a policy year. However, the number of permissible claims may vary from insurers to insurers. No doubt, the premiums are at higher side; however, the returns are better on a long-term basis.</p>                </div>
