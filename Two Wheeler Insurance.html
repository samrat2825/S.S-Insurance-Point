<h2><a>Types of Two Wheeler Insurance</a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>It is generally of two types: comprehensive policy and liability only insurance policy. The Indian Motor Vehicles Act makes it mandatory for all the two-wheelers that ply on public areas to have a minimum of third-party two wheeler insurance policy.</p>
<p>This means that any motor vehicle that is running on Indian roads such as cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, etc. need to have at least a third-party insurance cover. However, the cost of premium of a third-party insurance policy is comparatively less, and because of this reason most of the people prefer to buy it over a comprehensive policy. Whereas, a comprehensive policy is recommended as it covers you and your vehicle as well. Let's check out the details below:</p>
<h2>Comprehensive Two Wheeler Insurance</h2>
<p>The comprehensive two wheeler insurance, as the name suggest, provide total cover for the two-wheeler and the insured. It provides four-way insurance:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3>Protects from losses due to damages to the vehicle</h3>
<p>Any damage that is caused to the vehicle due to man-made disasters reasons or due to natural calamities is covered. Whatever the reason is the insurer will compensate the damages suffered by the two-wheeler and gets it back running into its original condition. Most insurance companies offer additional covers or optional features that you can opt to enhance the coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Personal accident cover</h3>
<p>Offer a personal accident cover up to Rs. 15 lakh to insure against any injuries that result in partial or total temporary or permanent disability or even death. The Indian motor insurance companies offer the optional benefit to add co-passenger. Companies also include this cover in their liability only two wheeler insurance policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Insures against third party liability</h3>
<p>Guard against any cause of action arising due to third-party liability. It covers legal liabilities arising due to:</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Third-party death or bodily injury</h3>
<p>Protect against any damage resulting due to 3rd party injuries or even death. These injuries may result in hospitalization, cause temporary or permanent damage or partial or total disability such as loss of limbs or eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Damages to third party property</h3>
<p>The insurance companies cover third-party property damage up to a specified limit as defined under the policy document.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Liability Only Policy</h2>
<p>The two-wheeler liability insurance policy only covers the policyholder against legal responsibilities arising due to injuries suffered by a third-party/person/vehicle/property from the insured 2-wheeler. As the name suggests, these types of plans do not safeguard against the damages incurred by the insured vehicle.</p>
<p>Most motor insurance companies in India also provide a personal accident cover for the owner of the motorcycle, moped or scooty. As per the new rules, all the motor insurance providers will offer multi-year ( 2 to 3 years) third-party insurance cover to all the two-wheelers that are purchased after Sept 01, 2018.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2><a>Why is Two Wheeler Insurance Policy Required?</a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Motor Vehicle laws mandate that any two-wheeler plying on all public roads in the country should have a minimum of third-party two wheeler insurance policy. Though it is not essential to buy a comprehensive policy, taking into consideration the nature of costs that may arise from a mishap or other man-made or natural disasters makes it essential to have a comprehensive insurance cover.</p>
<p>The motor insurance laws in India protect the millions of vehicle owners from expenses that may arise due to third-party damages, accidental damage, or theft of motorcycle, scooty, or moped.</p>
<p>Anybody who is driving on the Indian roads would have seen the unceasing growth in the number of automobiles in the country. The lack of good roads, the morning and evening rush hours, and unregulated traffic problems are a part and parcel of life today. In addition, events such as rainfall or heat waves may cause problems on the road such as slippery surfaces, mushy or muddy areas, or sticky tar that may cause damages to the vehicle and even injure the riders.</p>
<p><strong>This Policy Helps in a Number of Ways:</strong></p>
<p>It protects against the damages caused to the scooter, motorbike, or moped. Even the two-wheelers have been improvised and come with more speed, power, and style. The demand for superbikes makes it all the more necessary to buy a comprehensive two-wheeler policy. It offers protection to the bike owner and all the pillion riders.</p>
<p>These advances also mean the cost of automobiles has gone up along with the cost of their spare parts. Even the simple nuts and bolts or parts such as the gears or the brake pads are now costlier than before. Even a small damage can the cost you thousands of rupees.</p>
<p>As All this can be avoided with adequate two-wheeler insurance policy. These plans will help the insured to get the scooter, motorbike, moped repaired without creating a hole in their pocket. Let’s see what all it covers: Let’s see what all it covers:</p>

<h3>Accidental Cover</h3>
<p>Two-wheeler insurance guards against any injuries to the pillion rider and the co-passenger (if it is also there) from an accident. Most of these accidents result in medical costs of some kind or the other. The adverse effects of such costs can be mitigated with personal accident cover.</p>
<p>They amount of payout depends on the type of damages suffered. In an unfortunate event of the demise of the pillion rider due to a mishap, the full coverage amount is given to the nominees or family members. The amount may be lesser in case of simple injuries from which the person can recover easily, with or without hospitalization (as mentioned in the document wording or documented wordings).</p>
<p>Accidents may occur when the person is riding on the vehicle or is mounting from his motorbike, scooter or any other mechanized motorcycle. Check policy wording for more details.</p>

<h3>They insure against damages to third party property</h3>
<p>Often an accident may result in damages to the property in surroundings. This raises legal responsibilities as the damages will have to be reimbursed by the insured person. Insurance comes to the rescue in such cases as the policy ensures that the insured does not suffer due to the loss suffered by the third party. The plans provide clear definite terms and limitations up to which the insurer will reimburse the affected person.</p>
<p>Nearly all of these damages are settled through legal proceedings that ensure all actions are taken in strict accordance with the law of the country, and all causes and reimbursements are addressed in the manner prescribed under the statutes. The strict terms and conditions ensure that the insured does not suffer any loss due to events beyond their control, and the third party also receives the necessary compensation due to the loss suffered by them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>They offer peace of mind</h3>
<p>Motorcycles are generally purchased by young men and women and by the middle-class people in India. Whether it is Jammu and Kashmir or Andaman and Nicobar Islands, millions of these middle-class Indians use their motorcycles to commute from one place to another, for work or otherwise. For them, their motorbike, scooter, or moped is a means of their daily sustenance.</p>
<p>Even a small damage to their precious vehicle will mean rearranging the monthly household budget, and foregoing small pleasures to save on the costs incurred for repairing the motorbike. This policy works wonders for these people. It gives them a peace of mind as they don’t have to worry about how to pay for the expenditure. The insurance company will take care of these expenses for them, and they can ride easy, without any cause for worry.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Although, as per law it is compulsory only to buy&nbsp;3rd party bike insurance&nbsp;it is strongly advised to purchase a comprehensive policy to protect your two-wheeler from both man-made and natural calamities. By buying comprehensive cover, you can claim from your insurance company for accidents or damages caused to the vehicle. Without comprehensive cover, the entire responsibility to pay the bill comes on your shoulder. Thus, by opting for a comprehensive insurance policy, you can get complete peace of mind that whatever happens to your two-wheeler, the insurer will share your financial burden.</p>                </div>
