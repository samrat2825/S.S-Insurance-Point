<h2>How does Mediclaim Policy work?</h2>
<p>There are two types of claims available under Mediclaim policy-</p>
<h3><strong>Cashless Procedure:</strong></h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Cashless is a mechanism wherein a patient is treated in a network hospital, then insurer settles either the part of the claim or the entire claim with the hospital. It means, a patient doesn’t need to pay a penny to the hospital for the treatment. There are certain procedures which you need to follow to ensure the smooth claim process.</li>
<li>At the first level, all empanelled hospitals will have an insurance desk in their premises. A policyholder has to obtain a pre-authorization form from this desk, which has to be dully filled with correct information because any missed detail will only delay the entire process. This filled form needs to be stamped by the hospital and the doctor and then it has to fax across Third Party Administrator (TPA) or the insurer. After carefully examining the form, the company will approve a certain sum and send a fax back to the hospital saying that ‘X’ amount has been sanctioned for the treatment.</li>
<li>Let us understand this procedure with an example. If the hospital has given a treatment cost of Rs 4 lakh, the insurer and TPA will rework and for instance, approve Rs 3 lakh for treatment. Now, they will inform the hospital that they will reimburse expenses up to Rs 3 lakh only under cashless and if the total cost would be more than this limit, they will look at it later. However, at the time of discharge, the total billing amount comes at Rs 3.60 lakh. In this case, the policyholder has two options. The first option is, he will send all discharge letters and final bill copy to the insurer and wait for the revert. No doubt, it will take time. The other option is, policyholder himself pays the remaining amount, which is Rs 40,000 in this case, and then he submits those original bill receipts to the policy provider to get reimbursement of Rs 40,000.</li>

<h3><strong>Reimbursement:</strong></h3>
<p>In the case of reimbursement, it is pivotal to inform your insurance company that a hospitalization has been taken place or likely to take place in a near future. Either you could that by sending an email or by making a call. To get reimbursement, you need to submit all payment receipts, including bills of those medicines which you have bought from outside chemist. You need to make sure that original discharge card, final bills and payment receipts should be in one place, so that they can be submitted to the insurance company to get reimbursement.</p>

</ul>

<ul class="data_ul">

<h2>Factors to Consider while Finalising a Mediclaim Policy</h2>
<p>If you haven’t bought a mediclaim policy and are planning to apply for the one, then it is highly recommended to check below points to make sure that you buy best policy. These factors can also be used to compare different insurance plan options available in the market.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Individual and Family Floater:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In individual plan, each individual is insured for a specific amount, whereas, in family floater, the whole family is insured for a fixed sum assured. In case of family floater, when the primary person dies or reaches a specific age, the policy is closed even other members who are still younger can’t renew the policy. In Individual plan, the individual is insured on separate parameters. The attainment of specific age will not impact <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/family-health-insurance-plan/">insurance coverage of other family members</a>.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Sum Insured (the Coverage Amount):</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While choosing the coverage amount or the sum assured, it is recommended to take various factors such as rate of inflation, surging healthcare cost, etc. into consideration. Moreover, if you’re living in any metropolitan city, the costs of hospitalisation will be way higher than in rural areas. Likewise, if you opt for the sum insured of your loved ones also, you might want to take higher sum insured into consideration.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Co-payment Option:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Various mediclaim plans come with co-payment clause. The co-payment is usually a percentage sum that the insured has to bear while raising a claim before the insurance provider settles the rest. Such co-payments can range from 10% to 30% based on the insurance provider.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Exclusions:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every mediclaim plan is tailor-made so as to cover medical risks of the policyholder. Nevertheless, there are a few exclusions, which are either covered after a certain term or not covered at all. Conditions taking place due to reasons such as HIV infection, drug or alcohol addiction, suicide attempt, congenital diseases, etc. are not covered under the mediclaim policy. However, expenses related to hysterectomy, removal of kidney stones, gall bladder surgeries, and maternity, etc. are covered after a certain waiting period.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Network Hospitals:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important benefits of choosing mediclaim policy is the ease of the cashless settlement of the expenses incurred during hospitalisation. Every insurance provider has network hospitals and while seeking hospitalisation in any of such hospitals, you can avail cashless treatment if the treatment/hospitalisation is within the coverage scope. This aids in getting financial relief at the most crucial and critical times. Therefore, you must check out the network hospitals near your area, which have tie-ups with the insurance provider you want to purchase the policy from.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Renewability Age:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although, policy offers coverage for one year only, but in reality, it is a relationship between you and the insurance company. So, your <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/health-insurance-india/">health Insurance policy</a> should cover as you age because it is tough to get insurance at that age. If your policy doesn’t provide you coverage at that point of time then buying such a policy will not give peace of mind.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<h3><strong>Pre-Existing Disease:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is relevant only if you have a pre-existing disease at the time of taking insurance plan. It also covers those diseases which might arise from a pre-existing disease. For example, if you have diabetes at the time of taking the plan and later develop heart problem, then even the heart problem will be considered as a pre-existing disease. Almost all insurance companies have a clause that states that a pre-existing disease will be covered only if the plan has been renewed for a certain number of years. A best mediclaim insurance plan covers pre-existing diseases as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>There are two broad categories of healthy insurance &ndash; Benefits Policies and Indemnity policies:<br />a.) Benefits Policies<br />It is mostly traditional health insurance policies where you can claim pre-determine &ldquo;sum insured&rdquo; amount in the event of accident or treatment of any illness, diseases, etc. It offers you financial benefits up-front not necessarily demand hospital bills, etc.<br />b.) Indemnity policies<br />This policy reimburses or compensates the expenses incurred in the treatment or domiciliary care. The pre-mentioned amount in the policy will be given to the policyholder or the nominee when the necessary documents are submitted to the insurance company. The most important difference between health insurance and mediclaim is that mediclaim will only reimburse your expenses, and not provide you with the financial benefit in case you are unable to earn.</p>                </div>
