<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Importance of Health Insurance in India</h2>
<p><img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/Health/compare-health-insurance-plans.jpg" width="380" height="350" /></p>
<p>Health insurance in India is one of the fastest growing industries. However, this wide scope for growth indicates the limited penetration of health insurance among the Indian populace. As per the latest report released by National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) titled “Key Indicators of Social Consumption in India: Health”, only 20 percent of the Indian population had health insurance coverage. Additionally, only 18 percent of the total population residing in urban areas and 14 percent of the total population residing in rural areas had any form of health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Thus, there is no debating the importance of having insurance in a country like India where medical expenses are sky-rocketing. Everyone must buy a good health insurance policy that includes medical costs, hospitalisation costs, medication and laboratory test costs, including critical illness. Don’t get confused with questions like – Which health policy to buy? Does it cover every eventuality? What illnesses are excluded from this cover? PolicyBazaar is here to resolve all such confusions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Compare Health Insurance Plans &amp; Save Big</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is vital that you compare health insurance plans online in order to choose the best one to meet your healthcare needs. It can get confusing to select the best health insurance policy as so many insurance companies offer different health insurance plans with varied features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is no wonder that sometimes, people end up with a plan that, though costs less, has contradictory clauses, and they practically get nothing when a claim is filed. On the other hand, you end up buying a plan with a higher cost just to find out later that it has features that you did not use or might never need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment costs are increasing by the day. A Health insurance policy prevents a medical emergency from turning into a financial emergency. It makes sure that one's healthcare needs are taken care of without depleting his/her savings or compromising on one’s future goals.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Tips to Compare Medical Insurance Plans in India</h2>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">With more than 25 insurance companies and more than 200 health insurance products in the Indian health insurance market, comparing health plans and finding the best one is not an easy task. Enlisted below are a few pointers that can help make this process easier and smoother. One must go through these tips to make an informed decision:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Focus on the Sum Assured of Your Choice</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">The healthcare inflation in the country is skyrocketing and is increasing at the rate of 17% to 20% annually. To cover this inflation, it’s important to look for the maximum available sum assured at the best possible rate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Provide Complete &amp; Correct Details</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">Provide accurate information regarding your health in the proposal form, as any sort of inaccurate or mismatched information can make the insurer reject your claim form.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Keep in Mind the Factors That Influence the Premium</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">A few factors that influence the premium of a health plan include the proposer’s life history, family health history, lifestyle, smoking habits, etc. These are taken in account before the premium amount is determined.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Check the Credibility of the Company</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">Do go through the history of the insurance company you are planning to buy the plan from. You should select a company based on the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="data_ul" style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>ICR</strong>: Incurred Claim Ratio or ICR, is the most important parameter to check for when comparing health insurance companies. Each year, it is calculated using the following formula:</li>
</ul>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;"><img class="banner" src="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/Health/incurred-claim-ratio.JPG" alt="Incurred Claim Ratio" /></p>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">When taking in account the ICR of a company, look for the average ICR of all companies on PolicyBazaar and go for the one which is closest to this average for a period of few years.</p>
<ul class="data_ul" style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Customer Experience</strong>: You should always take heed to the mass opinion. Look for customer reviews online. If a large number of customers of an insurance company are unhappy, it may be because their customer support or after-sales service isn’t up to the mark.</li>
<li><strong>Find out the Claim Process</strong>: Though <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance-claim/">health insurance claim process</a> is pretty generic over providers, knowing the nitty-gritty of the process can help save a lot of hassle at the eleventh hour.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Incurred Claim Ratio and Claim Settlement Ratio in Health Insurance</h2>
<p>Incurred claim ratio or ICR is the net claim amounts that the insurer has paid in a year against the total net premiums earned. ICR of all the insurance providers is published by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India/IRDAI every year.</p>
<p>Basically, ICR is the total value of every claim that the company has paid and is divided by the total premium amount collected during the same duration.</p>
<p>Incurred Claim Ratio is derived by dividing Net earned premium in a year to the Net Claims Incurred in a year.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Claim Settlement Ratio is the ratio of the total claims settled by the health insurance provider to the total number of claims accepted in that time period.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Types of Health Insurance Plans in India</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the increasing cost of healthcare in India, buying a health insurance plan has become almost mandatory for everyone. There are various health insurance plans readily available in India to cater to every aspect of your medical needs. However, with plenty of options, ensuring the right plan can be difficult though. Hence, the online comparison comes in handy in purchasing health insurance plan. In this regard, some popular types of health insurance plans are explained below:</p>
<h3><strong>Individual Health Insurance Plan</strong></h3>
<p>This type of health insurance plan provides financial coverage to an individual policyholder against certain illnesses, offering advantages like cashless hospitalisation, reimbursement, coverage of pre-hospitalisation and post-discharge expenses and various add-ons. The entire sum assured is available for only one individual.</p>
<h3><strong><a title="Family Floater Health Insurance" href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/family-health-insurance-plan/" rel="alternate">Family Health Insurance Plan</a></strong></h3>
<p>With a family health plan, you can include your family members under the umbrella of a single health cover. Though family floater offers a higher premium than an individual plan, the expenses involved in buying separate individual plans still can be higher than this. Family floater mediclaim policies offer a fixed sum assured to the family members, which can be availed either by one or all members of a family for one or more claims during the tenure of the policy. Family health plans come are more expensive than an individual health plan.</p>
<h3><strong><a title="Senior Citizen Health Insurance" href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/senior-citizen-health-insurance/">Senior Citizen Health Insurance</a></strong></h3>
<p>Senior Citizen health insurance is designed particularly for anyone aged above 60 years and offers protection from health issues during old age. According to IRDAI, every health insurance firm must include people up to the age of 65 years in its plans.</p>
<h3><strong><a title="Critical Illness Insurance" href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/critical-illness-insurance/">Critical Illness Insurance</a></strong></h3>
<p>This plan is usually brought as a standalone policy or as a rider for the treatment of various critical illnesses, such as kidney failure, paralysis, cancer, heart attack etc. As the medication of such illnesses is expensive, the imbursement related to them is also very high. A critical illness is a serious, possibly terminal, disease and is pre-defined by the provider. Most critical illness policies provide a lump-sum benefit if the insured is diagnosed with one or more of the specified terminal conditions.</p>
<h3><strong><a title="Maternity Health Insurance" href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/maternity-insurance-policy/">Maternity Health Insurance</a></strong></h3>
<p>Medical insurance companies today cover additional costs, including those incurred in both pre and post-natal care, child delivery (normal or caesarean), and sometimes include vaccination of newborn babies in a maternity plan. This insurance covers the newborn baby up to the validity of this policy. It also covers transportation fee for ferrying the mom-to-be to the nearest network hospital of her choice.</p>
<h3><strong><a title="Personal Accident Insurance" href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/personal-accident-insurance/">Personal Accident Insurance Cover</a></strong></h3>
<p>These personal accident plans are frequently offered as riders. They include hospitalisation and bear the medical outlay in the event of an accident. These are issued as fixed benefit policies, where a specified sum is paid on the occurrence of unforeseen events, such as accidents, which can result in death or disability of the person. However, the payout is not related to the sum assured.</p>
<h3><strong>Pre-Existing Disease Cover</strong></h3>
<p>After 2-4 years of policy inception, various policies begin considering pre-existing diseases, e.g. diabetes, hypertension, kidney failure, cancer etc., for claims. Pre-existing disease cover is offered for the policy-specified illness(es) that the insured had before purchasing the policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Preventive Healthcare</strong></h3>
<p>Undoubtedly, healthcare is very expensive and nobody wants to fall ill. So, now we have preventive health care that takes care of you before you fall sick. Preventive care, such as regular health check-ups, concession in X-ray fees, consultation fee etc., is offered by this policy. By offering various healthcare provisions, this plan aims at keeping you healthy. Preventive care is a medical care rendered not for a specific complaint but for prevention and early-detection of ailments.</p>
<h3><strong>Unit Linked Health Plan</strong></h3>
<p>Unit- Linked Health Plan (ULHP) has been introduced recently, which offers a unique combination of health insurance and investment. Apart from giving health protection, ULHPs also contribute in building a corpus that can be used to meet expenditures which are not covered by health insurance policies.<br />Among the ULHPs available in Indian market, ICICI Pru's Health Saver, LIC's Health Protection Plus, Birla Sunlife's Saral Health and IndiaFirst's Money Back Health Insurance Plan are a few big names. By opting for this plan, one can save a certain amount which can later be used to pay for the treatment of any pre-existing illnesses that are not covered by a normal health policy during the waiting period.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Advantages &amp; Features of Health Insurance Policies in India</h2>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">The cost of healthcare in the modern days is increasing at a crazy rate while one’s earnings do not seem to match up that level. A patient looking forward to availing frequent health check-ups may no longer be able to bear the expenses associated. A comprehensive health insurance comes packed with features that can assist a person in managing expenses associated with medical emergencies and also with preventive healthcare. Understanding the following features can make purchasing a medical insurance policy easy:</p>
<ul class="data_ul" style="text-align: justify;">
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Cashless Treatment</strong>: Every medical insurance organization has tie-ups with various nursing homes and hospitals across the country called 'empanelled hospitals'. If you are admitted to one of these, you don’t need to pay anything. You only need to mention your policy number and everything else will be taken care of by the hospital and your insurer. This type of plan is preferred because there is no stress of claim reimbursement and arranging documentation. However, if your expenses go beyond the sub-limits specified by the insurance cover or marked as “not covered” by the provider, then you will have to settle it directly with the hospital. Another important thing to remember is that cashless Mediclaim is not available if one gets treatment at a hospital which is not a part of the hospital network of the insurance provider.</li>
<li><strong>Coverage of Pre and Post-Hospitalization expenses</strong>: This feature of a health insurance policy takes care of both pre and post-hospitalisation fee. It takes into account the costs incurred during a certain number of days both prior to and post hospitalization for a specified period from the date of discharge as part of the claim, provided the expenditures are related to the disease/sickness.</li>
<li><strong>Ambulance Fee</strong>: The person is free from burden of transportation fee as it is borne by the insurer. This is an add-on benefit and you should opt for it while purchasing medical insurance.</li>
<li><strong>No Claim Bonus</strong>: NCB (or No Claim Bonus) is a bonus provided to the insured if the no claim has been filed for any treatment in the previous policy year. The reward can be offered either as an increment in the sum assured or as a discount in the premium cost. You can avail this advantage on policy renewal.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Check-Up</strong>: A Medical plan entitles the insured to receive regular medical check-ups. A free check-up is provided by few insurers, provided you have a good history of no-claim bonus.</li>
<li><strong>Room Rent in Your Health Insurance Sub-limits</strong>: A health insurance policy may have various sub-limits associated with it; room rent is one of those sub-limits. General Insurance Companies provide you with a maximum coverage up to the sum assured. However, they can deliberately trim down their liability by introducing the sub-limit clause in the coverage for hospital room rent.<br />A sub-limit on room rent in case of hospitalization works on per day basis. For instance, if your medical insurance policy covers your daily room rent up to a maximum of Rs. 3,000 and your room costs you Rs. 5,000 per day, then you will have to pay the remaining Rs. 2,000 out of your own pocket. Besides, room charges are directly associated with the type of room you are availing, i.e. a single room or on a sharing basis. Everything else is calculated proportionately.<br />If the total cost incurred for your treatment at the hospital is Rs. 5,00,000, the table shown below illustrates the proportionate expenses that are expected to be borne by your insurer and you, respectively.</li>

<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">In this case, the total cost borne by you is Rs. 1,16,000 out of the total expense incurred, i.e. Rs. 5, 00,000. Thus, make sure you choose wisely if you want any such sub-limits in your health insurance policy.</p>
<ul class="data_ul" style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Co-Payment</strong>: According to this feature, you can lower the cost of your health insurance. Medical insurance plans offer co-payment option that pre-defines the voluntary deductibles which have to be borne by the insured. So, in the event of a medical exigency, some amount is paid by the customer and the rest, by the provider. Co-payment is a cost-sharing requirement under a health policy, which states that the organization or the person will bear a certain share (in percentage) of the total admissible cost. However, the co-payment option does not have any effect on the sum assured. It allows you to reduce your premium to a certain extent (subject to the insurer and insurance policy).</li>
<li><strong>Tax Benefits of Health Insurance</strong>: Health insurance policies entitle you to receive tax benefits under section 80D of Income Tax Act, 1961. The premium you pay towards insurance plans for yourself or your family members, get you a tax rebate, irrespective of whether they are dependent on you or not. The tax benefit offered, with respect to the premiums, is subject to the age of the person and there is a cap on the maximum benefit that can be availed. You can save a max up to Rs. 25, 000 in taxes a year unless your age is above 60 years. If your age is above 60 years, then this cap of maximum tax benefit increases to Rs. 30, 000.<br />If you are paying the insurance premiums for your parents as well as your own, then you are eligible for tax exemption up to Rs. 55, 000 a year under section 80D, provided your parents are senior citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Health Insurance by Employer</strong>: More than 80% of employers in today’s age provide health coverage to their employees. The health insurance offered by an employer covers hospitalization expenses of the employee and his/her family including spouse, children or parents. It is a wise decision to opt for the mediclaim offered by your company as you need not pay any premium. This comes under a <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/group-health-insurance/">group health insurance policy</a> and the premium is paid by the employer, based on the group size and the opted benefits.<br />However, it might be that you feel your employer’s mediclaim policy is insufficient to fulfil your medical needs. Also, what if you change your job? You will no longer be a member of this plan once you leave the organisation. Hereby Hence, it is necessary to understand the policy terms thoroughly. You can communicate with the HR department regarding what’s covered and what’s not in your health insurance. Mostly, we have observed that employees are more than satisfied with their company providing health insurance, only to find out later that the plan is not sufficient. So, before it’s too late, make your call!</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Administrators</strong>: The TPA concept is the brainchild of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA), to assist both the insured and the insurer. While it benefits the insurer by reducing their overheads or administrative costs, fake claims, and claim ratios, the insured, too, enjoy improved and fast insurance services.<br />TPAs are an important players in the sector of health insurance. They have the capacity to handle all or a portion of the claims related to mediclaim insurance. They have tie-ups with the health insurers or self-insuring companies to manage services such as premium collection, enrollment, claim settlement and other administrative services. Often, hospitals and insurance companies organizations outsource health and insurance-related responsibilities to lower their burden. Similarly, an employer may prefer to provide claim resolution of the group health insurance policy via a TPA to manage various aspects of an employer-funded healthcare policy.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors to Consider Before Buying Medical Insurance Plans in India</h2>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;"><a class="single_image " href="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/Health/how-to-buy-best-health-insurance.jpg"><img class="banner" src="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/Health/compare-health-insurance-policy.jpeg" alt="Buy Health Insurance Plan" /></a></p>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">There are few factors that you should consider closely to make the right decision.</p>
<ul class="data_ul" style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Caps and sub-limits:</strong> Caps and sub-limits are the thresholds set on various policy-covered expenses. If a health policy has impositions of co-payments, sub-limits, and other caps, this would mean that there will be a policy-stated coverage offered for various expenses. At times, co-pay clause and caps help in reducing the premium of the plan. These, however, would alter the benefits in the long run. To make the most of your health insurance policy, you must understand these factors before you pay for a plan.</li>
<li><strong>Claim settlement record:</strong> This is an important criterion to assess the credentials of an insurer. You should always go with a company with a good claim settlement record. Thus, you can ensure that your claims would not be wrongly withheld. Always ask for the company’s claim settlement ratio before purchasing their health plans and save yourself from unnecessary harassment in future.</li>
<li><strong>Scope of cover:</strong> Don’t buy a plan by just comparing health insurance premium. Less cost does not necessarily mean a good plan. On the contrary, such a plan might not consider your needs properly. Closely look at what the plan includes. Buying a comprehensive plan is a better option comes to your rescue when you need it the most.</li>
<li><strong>Renewability:</strong> It is important to see how many years the plan proposes to protect you. It makes no sense if you are covered by a health insurance plan during your youth only to be left without a safeguard when you need it the most - during your old age. Mediclaim policies are usually annual contracts. Once the policy term ends, in the order to continue the insurance coverage, the insured has to pay a premium. This recurring process is called renewal. The policy should be renewed continuously, because if there is a break, then, the person will lose the benefits of insurance.</li>
<li><strong>Cashless Hospital Network:</strong> Check if a hospital around you is included by the company you are considering to buy the plan from. You and your family won’t be required to run around collecting documents and filling reimbursements. The provider or its Third Party Administrator should have a tie-up with a range of hospitals. The insured can get admitted in any of these nursing homes without paying anything from the pocket. However, cashless mediclaim resolution is subject to limits and sub-limits, which, in turn, are subject to the sum assured of the policy.</li>
<li><strong>Premium Loading:</strong> Premium Loading refers to the increase in standard premium applicable when the insurer perceives a person to be more at risk (of claiming the insurance) in comparison to others. It is strongly recommended that you check the terms and conditions pertaining to premium loading. This will save you from paying an incremented premium after making a claim. This aspect, though ignored in the beginning, usually becomes a bone of discontentment later. The best practice would be to verify the cost fluctuation data of the plan for the previous 5 years at the very least.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Team:</strong> Check for plans from firms who have a dedicated internal team for handling Mediclaim. This expedites the Mediclaim resolution process. Most of the players use a third-party administrator to process the claims and do the paperwork. Even though most of these Administrators provide great services, the fact that they are a third-party slows down the process. There are certain rules and regulations to be followed when an administrator processes a claim before it is handed over to the insurance company. These affect the turnaround time.</li>
<li><strong>Floater (family) Size:</strong> Everyone has a different family size, so you should always look for the family size allowed under the plan before purchasing it. If you are a person in your late 20s and your parents are in their 40s, 50s or 60s, then purchasing insurance only for yourself does make sense. Alternatively, if you are married with or without kids and have dependent parents, parents-in-law, siblings etc., then a family health plan is best for you. Checking the cost, family size covered, critical illnesses or other benefit will ensure that you are able to purchase the plan you need.</li>
<li><strong>Health Insurance Portability:</strong> It is wise to choose a health insurance company that offers health insurance portability. Earlier, policyholders had to stick to a policy just to retain the advantage. Now, you are allowed to switch from one insurance company to another without losing the waiting period advantages earned in your current policy. Moreover, with insurance landscape changing so regularly, insurance companies regularly come up with better policies and it may make sense to opt for health insurance policy portability. Although health insurance portability is free, some companies may charge you a certain fee if you are to port out of their plans to those of some other players. Therefore, make sure you do not pay any charges for medical insurance portability. Health insurance portability is a good thing to check when you are finding the best health policy or mediclaim.</li>
<li><strong>Restore Benefit:</strong> With 'restore benefit' facility in your health care plan, you can restore your basic sum assured in case you have already spent the same or the multiplier advantage during your policy tenure. Mostly, the benefit cannot be obtained on the same ailment if you have exhausted the existing sum limit.<br />Restoration assistance proves to be helpful for a family floater health plan, where if the entire sum assured is used in the treatment of only a single family member, the other members are not left uncovered. In such a case, the other family members can avail policy coverage for the illness other than the one for which the expenses have already been compensated by the insurer.<br />Well, while finalising your health insurance plan, you should consider other influencing factors such as waiting period, sub-limit, claim settlement procedures etc. You can replace restore benefit with a super top-up plan at an affordable price. Moreover, top-up plans are more comprehensive since they comes with less or no restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Top up Plans:</strong> With the rise of medical inflation, having a large medical cover is prudent. But, not all can afford it due to the high premium. This is where a top-up plan comes into the picture. A top up plan reduces the deductibles cost i.e. the portion of claim you pay willingly for the damages before the insurer compensates the rest or up to the sum assured. With a top up policy, you don’t pay until a hospital breaks its defined limit. A top up plan is considered far cheaper than a standalone medical policy.<br />For instance, if the medical bill is Rs. 6 lakhs with a deductible of Rs. 2 lakhs, you are required to pay only the latter amount and the remaining 4 lakhs will be paid by the insurer. But, you can utilise your health policy to pay the liable amount. Again, the blending of a top-up plan with a medical cover is helpful as the premium you pay is much more affordable than the single plan. For example, if you pay 6,500 as a premium for Rs. 5 lakh regular cover, a top up coverage of Rs. 15 lakh will entail to an additional premium of 5,000, which is anyhow cheaper than a separate policy of identical cover.</li>
<li><strong>Waiting Period:</strong> As per the insurance norms, every insured must serve a defined waiting period for any pre-existing illness. It is usually a 30-day period from the day your health insurance policy is initiated. If any claim falls during the waiting period, the insurer has the right to reject the claim for any hospitalisation, except in the case of an emergency. A hospitalisation that arises out of an accident can be registered as a claim and the insurer will compensate the hospitalisation cost. However, the insured is not required to serve the waiting period for subsequent years.</li>

<h2>Health Insurance Portability Explained</h2>
<div>
<p class="paragraphBu">You do not have to stick to your current insurer any longer if you do not want to since IRDA now allows you to change your current insurer without losing any of the existing benefits. Previously, if you changed your insurer, then you had to compromise on the benefits, viz. coverage for any pre-existing disease offered by your existing medical insurance policy.<br />According to the new rules, IRDA allows you to switch from one insurer to another while the new insurer will have to consider the credits you gained from your previous insurer, where credits refer to the waiting period under pre-existing conditions. The same applies if you switch from one plan to another with the same insurance company.</p>
<h3>What you can do</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Switch from one health insurance company to another</li>
<li>Any family floater or individual policy can be switched from/to.</li>
<li>Avail insurance cover by your new insurer up to the sum assured by the previous policy.</li>
<li>Both the insurers should mutually complete the formalities as per the IRDA timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Criteria to meet</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>A policy can be switched only at the time of renewal.</li>
<li>With the new policy, the terms and conditions, including the premium are at the discretion of the new insurer.</li>
<li>Submit a formal shifting request to your current insurer at least 45 days before the due date of the renewal.</li>
<li>Make sure you specify the name of the new insurer you are willing to switch to.</li>
<li>There should not be any break between policy renewals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health Insurance Premium Calculator</h2>

You pay a fixed amount of money in exchange for that at certain intervals to ensure that the policy remains in force. Did you ever think how this premium is calculated? There are multiple certain factors that affect your health insurance premium, including some provider-specific terms, such as the medical background of your family, your personal medical history and so forth.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h2>Factors That Affect Your Health Insurance Premium</h2>
<div>
<p class="paragraphBu">With advancement in medical facilities, health care costs have also increased. The main benefit of health insurance is that it takes care of the healthcare expenses. It offers financial security to you and your family in the event of an unanticipated serious illness or accidental injuries that could drain all your savings. And here’s how the cost of your insurance premium is determined:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Medical History</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Your medical history is one of the major determinants of the health insurance premium.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">Almost all the insurance companies in India make pre-medical tests mandatory (after a certain age) before buying a health insurance policy.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">While, some insurance companies don’t make medical screening mandatory but do consider your current medical conditions, lifestyle-related health risks and medical background of your family. <br /> <br /> That is why medical insurance premium for smokers is higher than other people.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Gender and Age</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Age is another important determinant of the medical insurance premium. The premium varies based on the age of the insured person. <br /> <br /> That is why it is recommended to buy a policy at a young age because the cost of the premium is low for young applicants.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">Elderly people are vulnerable to cardiovascular diseases, and other critical illnesses such as cancer, kidney problems etc. For this reason, senior citizen medical insurance premium is usually on a higher side</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">Also, the cost of the premium for women health insurance is lower in comparison to the male candidates due to lower risk of stroke, heart attack etc.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Policy Term</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">The premium for a 2-year health insurance plan will be higher than a 1-year plan. However, almost all the insurance companies offer a discount on long-term medical insurance plans.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Type of Health Insurance Plan</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">The type of policy you select also affects the cost of the premium. The higher the risks involved the higher will be the premium and vice-versa. <br /> With the help of an online health insurance premium calculator, you can compare the premium for different plans.</p>
<h3><strong>5. No-Claim-Discount</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">If you have not made any claim during your policy term, then you can earn NCB or No-claim-bonus ranging from 5 to 50 percent. It is also one of the most important factor that is taken into consideration while calculating the cost of the premium.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Lifestyle</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">If you drink or smoke regularly, chances are high that you will be charged more premium amount. In that case, the insurer can also reject your insurance policy request.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h2>Health Insurance Eligibility Criteria</h2>
<div>
<p class="paragraphBu">Health insurance policy is mandatory for almost everyone, especially for those who have dependents and/or families since they certainly do not want them to have financial strains. Buying a medical insurance policy ensures that one's health is secured and medical expenses are covered across a wide network of hospitals in India. One can opt for the best health insurance policy with extended coverage on the following two bases:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Individual</li>
<li>Family Floater</li>
</ul>

<li>Policy renewability: Lifelong and subject to medical clearance</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h2>Important Points to Remember while buying Health Insurance</h2>
<div>
<p class="paragraphBu">Buying insurance is not child’s play and when it comes to buying a health insurance policy, you need to be pretty sure about certain points. A few of such key points are listed below:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>What covers are you offered and who offers the covers?</li>
<li>Are add-on features available for later use?</li>
<li>Are individual and/or family floater options available?</li>
<li>What is the Sum Assured?</li>
<li>What are Sum-limits applicable?</li>
<li>Is/are there any discount(s) offered?</li>
<li>Are there any voluntary/co-payment deductible options?</li>
<li>Are policy exclusions mentioned in the documents?</li>
<li>What is the claim process like? – Reimbursement, cashless benefit, immediate claim settlement?</li>
<li>Is there any medical check-up required before proposal acceptance?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h2>Health Insurance Claim Procedures</h2>
<div>
<p class="paragraphBu">Medical plans come with additional benefits of cashless treatment and expense reimbursement by the insurer. One can file a claim against an event that is covered by the insurance policy. Following are two claim processes:</p>
<h3><strong>Expense Reimbursement:</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Health insurance policies provide the insured with the benefit of getting their medical expenses reimbursed by the insurer, based on the policy terms documented. The cost of various hospital charges such as bed charges, medicines, lab tests, surgeon's fees etc. are paid back to the insured at the time of claim. The insured pays the (hospital) expenses, but gets reimbursed by the insurance company.</p>
<h3><strong>Cashless Treatment:</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Insurance companies provide policyholders with a wide network of hospitals to get medical treatment without having to make upfront payments. No payment is required to be done by the insured, since the clause involves a mutual agreement between both the parties, i.e. the insurer and hospital. In contrast, availing cashless benefit requires TPA approval.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">The insured can also show the insurer-issued health card at the particular hospital as a proof of medical insurance cover along with a valid government ID. Following cases considered for cashless treatment:</p>
<h3><strong>Planned Hospitalization:</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">In case of planned hospitalization, to avail health insurance benefit the policyholder needs to have TPA approval in advance along with other mandatory documents. Fill the pre-authorization form at the hospital signed by the treating doctor(s).</p>
<h3><strong>Emergency Hospitalization:</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Show the health card issued by the insurer at the hospital along with the appropriately-filled pre-authorization form to get TPA approval for emergency hospitalization. If you fail to get TPA approval, get the expenses reimbursed later. The policyholder might have to show itemized bill, proof of medical expenses, discharge bill etc., as the proof of the treatment availed to avail claim reimbursement.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h2>Documents Required for Health Insurance Claim Reimbursement</h2>
<div>
<p class="paragraphBu">In the event of hospitalization, the policyholder needs to submit certain documents as mentioned below:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Discharge card issued by the hospital.</li>
<li>In-patient hospitalization bills signed by insured for authenticity.</li>
<li>Doctors’ prescriptions and medical store bills.</li>
<li>Claim-form with insured’s signature on it.</li>
<li>Valid investigation report.</li>
<li>Consumables and disposables prescribed by the doctors with complete details.</li>
<li>Bills of doctors’ consultation.</li>
<li>Copies of the Insurance policy from the previous year and the current year/copy of ID Card of TPA.</li>
<li>Any other document(s) asked by the TPA.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Some Myths about Health Insurance</strong></h2>
<p>Before relying on the information it is imperative to check the facts and then buy a health insurance policy. Mentioned below are some popular myths that most people believe about medical policies:</p>
<h3><strong>I am Healthy, and I Don't Need Medical Insurance</strong></h3>
<p>Despite taking good care of your health, there are numerous unforeseen circumstances like seasonal illnesses, dengue, malaria, or an accident can hit anyone anytime. Nowadays, hospitalization expenses are not easy to pay off. Even 2-days of hospitalization expenses would cost you somewhere between INR 60,000 to INR 1 lakh and even more (depending on the type of illness).</p>
<h3><strong>My Health Insurance will Cover all the Medical Expenses</strong></h3>
<p>As per the IRDA regulations, every health plan comes with a set of exclusions/limitations. It is required that you check all the policy details and the coverage that is mentioned in the plan. The insurer will only compensate for the expenses that are covered in the policy and up to the specified limit.</p>
<h3><strong>Declaration of Pre-existing Diseases</strong></h3>
<p>It is essential to declare all the pre-existing diseases in the proposal form. One must mention pre-existing diseases clearly before buying a health policy. Inadequate information can lead to rejection of the claim and can cost more than the expected amount.</p>
<h3><strong>Smokers are not Eligible to Buy a Health Insurance Plan</strong></h3>
<p>As per the survey, nearly 49% of the applicants or consume alcohol are perplexed to buy a health insurance policy. But there are insurance companies that offer medical insurance to them as well. But taking into consideration the risks, alcohol consumers, and smokers would need to undergo a stringent pre-medical examination procedure and pay a higher premium to get health insurance coverage. <br />Medical Insurance will only cover hospitalization expense</p>
<h3><strong>Medical Insurance will only Cover Hospitalization Expense</strong></h3>
<p>Though most of the insurance plans cover medical expenses for hospitalization more than 24-hours. There are plans that have a capping on the duration of hospitalization as well. But most of the insurers these days cover daycare procedure as well, where 24-hours of hospitalization is not required. It includes cataract surgery, varicose veins surgery and similar procedure.</p>
<h3><strong>I am Covered Under a Group or Corporate Health Insurance Plan</strong></h3>
<p>Most people rely on the health insurance plan that is provided by their employer. It is important to know that a group health insurance comes with a set of limitations. It will not offer coverage to your family members in most of the cases, the sum assured will not be sufficient, it will not cover critical illnesses. Also, buying a cover after retirement or losing a job can prove to be an expensive affair.</p>

<h2>List of Government Health Insurance Schemes in India</h2>
<h3><strong>Ayushman Bharat Scheme</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>The government’s Ayushman Bharat Scheme aims to offer medical coverage to at least 50 lakh Indians.  The insurance programme focuses on two aspects: One focus is to ensure health insurance cover of Rs. 5 lakhs to each family, including in-patient hospitalization expenses and tertiary care. Another focus is to develop health and wellness centers for these people.  The scheme has already benefitted 10 lakh Indians. Moreover, 1.5 lakh wellness centers would be set up by December 2022.</p>
<h3>Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY)</h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">It is a government-of-India-backed health insurance scheme, which offers coverage against personal accident resulting in accidental disabilities, or death on account of an accident. It is offered for a period of one year and requires annual renewals. The policy is available with all public sector insurance companies that deal in the general insurance sub-domain. All private sector insurers are open to selling the scheme on a similar set of terms in collaboration with various banks upon necessary approval. Anyone within the age group of 18 to 70 years, with a savings account in any of the participating banks can benefits from the scheme while the AADHAR would be the prime KYC for the scheme and bank account.</p>

<h3>Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY)</h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">A government-run health insurance scheme for poor people in India, it provides them with the cashless facility at various public and private hospitals across the country. Enrolled in 2008, the scheme already has over 36 million families (as on February 2014) enrolled across 25 Indian states. The operations under this plan started under the Ministry of Labor and Employment and were transferred to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on April 1, 2015. As this plan works for BPL (Below Poverty Line) families, they get a smart-card that is biometric-enabled to become eligible for inpatient medical care worth Rs. 30, 000 per year at an empanelled hospital. The coverage for pre-existing diseases is there right from day one for parents and up to three children.</p>
<h3>Universal Health Insurance Scheme (UHIS)</h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Aimed at improving the health standards of people at or below the poverty line, four of the public sector general insurers implemented UHIS in India. Under this scheme, the eligible families can get reimbursement for medical expenses up to Rs. 30, 000 and accidental death benefit of Rs. 25, 000 to the breadwinner in the family. The loss of income of the family is also compensated with Rs. 50 per day up to 15 days in a month. The scheme was revised later, thereby increasing the premium subsidy from Rs. 100 to Rs. 200 for an individual and Rs. 300 for a family of 5 members and Rs. 400 for a family of 7 members.</p>
<h3>Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana (AABY)</h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">A government-of-India-run scheme for people from rural regions of India, who are landless, was launched in October 2007 and covers the prime earner in the family with the benefits. An annual premium of Rs. 200 is payable by the family, which is divided between the Central Government and State Government, while the age of the insured lies between 18 and 59 years. Below are the benefits</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../../../../health-insurance/general-info/articles/health-insurance-portability-in-india/">Health insurance portability</a> can be exercised only at the time of renewing a policy, not at any time during the policy term. Switching to a new firm can be easy if you follow below simple steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An insured needs to send an application to port the policy to the new firm which should reach at least 45 days prior to the last day of renewal of the current policy. Though the insurance company is free to consider a proposal even if the person fails to approach them before 45 days of policy renewal, but in that scenario it will not be legally bound to consider your application. So, chances are high that your application will be rejected. Once your request is received by the new firm, they will send proposal and portability forms along with details of different products offered by it. Choose the insurance product which suits you most and fill up the proposal and portability forms and submit them to the new firm. After receiving both the forms, insurance company will approach your current firm seeking details like medical history and claim history. The data will be received through a common data sharing portal developed by IRDA for all insurance companies. The current firm will have to furnish all details about your policy within seven working days. After the new firm receives all details regarding your previous policy, he has to take a decision on underwriting your insurance application within 15 days. If the new firm fails to abide by this duration, he will be bound to accept your application.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The waiting period is a defined time-period that the insured has to serve to cover the pre-existing illness. No claim during this period will be accepted by the insurer except the case of an emergency hospitalisation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If I increase my policy Sum Insured at the time of renewal, do any waiting periods apply?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the increase of the Sum Insured, waiting periods will be applicable afresh. Let&rsquo;s say if the waiting period is 3 years, a claim for the cover can be claimed only after serving 3 years from the date of inception of the policy.

However, more commonly NCB is offered in the form of discount on the payable total. NCB is quite attractive for a healthy person who has bought health insurance policy for emergency situations.

<li style="text-align: justify;">Buying a health policy is not an easy task. There are various factors that collectively play an important role in deciding the total cost which you need to shell out to get cover. Young, healthy people need to pay far less for insurance than their old counterparts. Similarly, if you are buying a single policy then total payable would be low in comparison to a family health plan as the latter is a comprehensive plan that includes protection for the entire family, whereas the former covers only one. Similarly, corporate health insurance is cheap as it is similar to buy policies in bulk.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The cost of&nbsp;medical insurance also depends upon total assured. If you opt for a higher assured total, your premium rates will increase. Similarly any rider attached with the plan increases its cost. For instance, premium rates of a basic health policy offering Rs 3 lakh to a person aged 30 years would vary between Rs 3000-4000/annum. But if you take a critical illness rider, you have to spend more 1500-2000/annum.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The cost of health insurance also varies on the basis of the health condition of a person. For example, an unhealthy person who is already suffering from any pre-existing condition may need to pay higher total in the form of loading as compared to a healthy person who doesn&rsquo;t need to pay the loading fees.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Also, in certain scenarios, the total payable may vary from the city to city. For example, a person living in metro city may need to pay the higher cost as compared to the other person of same age and family size living in the remote area, for the same assured total.</li>

                    <p>A rider is an add-on option that can be added to a current health policy to get additional cover. There are various riders available in&nbsp;medical&nbsp;insurance sector and some of the major ones are listed below-</p>
<ol class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Critical illness rider</strong>= There are certain critical ailments, such as heart attack, paralysis, cancer, etc; for which medical expenses are too high to be covered under a regular health policy. Under critical illness rider, mostly lump-sum is paid to the person and this total is substantial for massive expenses which are involved due to critical illness.</li>
<li><strong>Hospital Cash</strong>= Insurer provides fixed cash on a daily basis to compensate the loss of income &amp; meet petty expenses of the person during hospital stay</li>
<li><strong>Top-ups</strong>= If there is a change in the inclusion needed or paying ability increases, then it is better to opt for a top-up insurance plan than buying an individual plan. It helps in expanding the current health insurance cover.</li>
<li><strong>Attendant allowance</strong>= Some insurers are giving attendant allowance to accompany the insured person who is hospitalized.</li>
<li><strong>Co-Payment</strong>= It is the portion of the claim that a policyholder agrees to pay in the event of a claim. For a policyholder, main benefit comes in the form of low premium. The higher the ratio, the lower is the premium. A healthy person whose chances of being hospitalized are low can consider buying a policy with this deductible.</li>
<li><strong>Deductible</strong>= Also known as &lsquo;excess&rsquo;, deductible is the uninsured part of the claim amount which the person has to pay before the insurance company takes over and pays remaining expenses as per the policy. Since the firm shifts the small portion of risk on you, he gives you discounts on the payable total. Unlike co-payment, the person has to first pay his portion and then only firm settles the remaining portion.</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Any health problem faced by one prior to seeking insurance policy is called pre-existing diseases. Insurance companies are reluctant to cover such diseases as it is a costlier affair for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem is that people with such conditions usually do not get warm welcome from insurance companies. But it should not deter you from buying a health plan even if you have any such ailment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every insurance company has its own conditions regarding such illnesses. Some firms prefer to check a person&rsquo;s entire medical history to know pre-existing condition status, while other insurers will look for medical records over the past four years. So while choosing a policy, you should also need to compare waiting period stipulated in policies for covering such ailments.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A) Buying health insurance can be a painstaking process, so you should make sure you keep below things in mind before buying a health insurance policy.</p>
<p>B) <strong>What&rsquo;s covered and what&rsquo;s not covered in the policy</strong>= No health policy includes all illnesses, so it is important to know the list of covered illnesses</p>
<p>c) <strong>Pre-existing diseases</strong>= Be upfront about your current health state and pre-existing diseases. Concealing information may become the reason of claim rejection.</p>
<p>d) <strong>When does it start</strong>= No&nbsp;medical insurance includes starts covering from Day 1. So it is important to know when your inclusion will start. If you will undergo medication before that time, you will not be entitled to get a claim.</p>
<p>e) <strong>Family or individual policy</strong>= A family insurance plan considers entire family under one plan and is cheaper than individual policy. However, it is crucial to check what happens if the main insured of the plan dies. Some policies may lapse while some won&rsquo;t. Also, taking a family plan with your ageing parents would mean that most of your inclusion would go in their treatment and less inclusion would be available for the rest of the family.</p>
<p>f) <strong>Understand the premium</strong>= Costs of healthcare services are rising exponentially. Thus, it is important to have comprehensive health inclusion so that timely medication could be made. However, before you buy a plan, it is crucial to compare costs with the total assured total and cover. There is no sense in taking up low priced plan if it includes only a few sicknesses.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A critical illness benefit complements the health insurance benefits. While mediclaim takes care of hospitalization expenses, critical illness cover is used to cover extra costs that may arise while seeking treatment for critical diseases like cancer, stroke, coronary heart disease, major organ failure, paralysis, etc.&nbsp; Under critical illness, insurer agrees to pay a lump sum amount on diagnosis of dreadful diseases listed in the policy document. The lump sum amount that you get can be used for different purposes like paying for expensive treatment or recuperation aids, make up for the loss of income due to fall in the ability to earn, etc.</p>
<p>Imagine an individual who has been diagnosed with coronary heart disease and the patient has a health plan of Rs 5 lakh. In a regular health plan, payment is usually associated with hospitalization but what happens if total expenses connected with treatment are Rs 8 lakh, out of which hospitalization expense is Rs 5 lakh? Now who will bear Rs 3 lakh expenses (8-5) related to innumerable diagnostic pre &amp; post hospitalization? Having a critical illness plan would give an additional amount to cover Rs 3 lakh expenses.</p>
<p>A critical illness plan supplements your&nbsp;medical insurance portfolio. The purpose of a critical illness cover is to pay for costly treatments. The scope of coverage is much wider as it covers up to 20 critical illnesses. Moreover, general insurance companies offer a critical illness cover for 1-5 years. It means, you have ample coverage for a longer duration.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sum Assured is a pre-determined benefit paid by the insurance company. In case of an accidental death of the policyholder, the insurer pays the nominee the sum assured and the policy ceases right away. Let&rsquo;s say, you buy a policy with health coverage of Rs. 5 lakh. At the time of buying, the insurer guarantees to pay, a pre-decided amount of 2 lakh to the nominee in case of your accidental demise. This 2 lakh is your sum assured.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one of the determinants, based on which the insurer decides the premium amount payable for a particular health plan.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Inform the insurer and submit the filled reimbursement claim form within 30 days from the date of release from the hospital</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. You are required to submit all the original and duly stamped medical reports, medical bills and hospital bills with the claim form. Registration number of the hospital is required to be mentioned in the hospital bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. A discharge card, which ensures that you are medically fit, is to be submitted to the insurer as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Doctor&rsquo;s follow-up prescription should also be submitted at the time of filing a claim. For a post-hospitalization expense to be covered, you can submit the bills within 60/90/120 days from discharge, as per your insurer&rsquo;s norms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Keep copies of all submitted documents for future reference and retain them all. The insurer will follow you once the claim is registered and he/she will further guide you. Usually, a claim is settled within 2-3 weeks after it is registered.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">An individual health insurance plan only provides coverage for an individual, whereas a family floater plan ensures coverage for the entire family in case of a medical emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, an individual plan costs more than a family health insurance floater plan, which is why most individuals opt for family floaters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Family floaters also offer a higher sum insured than individual health insurance plans, in case of only one claim in a year.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of getting a Health Insurance plan can be significantly higher for those who are regular tobacco users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is because smoking predisposes an individual to various diseases like heart complications, hypertension, respiratory issues, cancer, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the number of smokers is higher for men, women who smoke are also prone to osteoporosis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result, the premiums for health insurance are higher for smokers and tobacco users are higher than those who do not smoke.</p>                </div>
