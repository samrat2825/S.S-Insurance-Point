<p>Third party insurance is a type of insurance policy that is designed for offering insurance coverage to the third party in case of an accident caused by the insured vehicle. This policy covers the liability arising out of an injury, damage or death of the third party, where the insured vehicle is at fault.</p>
<p>As per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, Third Party Insurance is a statutory requirement. Under this policy, the prime beneficiary of the policy is neither the original insured nor the insurance company, but a pretentious third party. As per the rules, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) of India compute the damages.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Do You Need Third Party Insurance?</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>Besides the legal clause, Third Party Insurance comes in handy when your vehicle hits another vehicle. You can’t measure the level of damage caused by an accident - it might lead to death as well. In such instances, the victim is allowed to register a case claiming for compensation. Here third party insurance comes into the picture. It covers the insured vehicle in case any liability claim arises out of bodily injury, property damage, or death of the third party. As per the guidelines of IRDA, while there is no limit in case of death, the property damage cover is limited up to Rs. 7.5 lakh in case of car insurance and Rs.1 lakh in case of two wheeler insurance. It is better sticking to third party liability insurance if you own a vehicle that is more than 5 years old.</p>
<h2 align="left"><strong>Key Benefits &amp; Importance of Third-Party Insurance:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Offers Legal Cover and Financial Assistance:</strong></h3>
<p>The legal liability of the insured person is covered under the third party insurance policy in the case of disability or demise of the third party, and any damage or loss to the property of the third party. The third-party liability policy takes care of the financial and legal burden on the insured. Despite the fact that the direct beneficiary is neither the insurance company nor the insurer, but a third party, this is the most crucial benefit that a third party insurance ensures for the owner or the driver of the insured vehicle.</p>
<h3><strong>Easy, Seamless and Fast ­Process to Acquire the Third Party Insurance:</strong></h3>
<p>The third party liability insurance can be bought and access easily. You can also renew this policy online by visiting the official website and by following the instructions online.</p>
<h3><strong>Cost-effective Policy</strong></h3>
<p>The coverage offered under third party liability insurance appears exceptionally cost-effective and rewarding in terms of its cost and premium rate. Even if you have to use this as either an essential or an add-on part of the main policy, it benefits you fully. However, at the time of calculating the compensation amount, insured’s annual income is considered.</p>
<div class="icon-div">
<h2><strong>Features of Third-Party Car Insurance:</strong></h2>
</div>

</ul>
<p><strong>The following salient features are a part and parcel of third party insurance plan:</strong></p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>The policy holder, the insured or the injured third party are the beneficiaries of the third party liability insurance. These beneficiaries are only the nominal beneficiary of the third party car insurance. In practise, the money is directly paid to the third party or his solicitor by the insurance company.</li>
<li>Injuries to the insured himself are not covered under third party car insurance. It covers the injuries caused by the insured to the rest of the world.</li>

<div class="icon-div"><span class="sprite_content third-party-liability" title="Third Party Insurance for Car">icon</span>
<h2><strong>Third Party Liability Car Insurance:</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>Third Party Car Insurance is a risk cover, under which the insurer compensates any legal liabilities claimed by the other party involved in an accident, where the insured vehicle is at fault. As per the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, Section 146, plying an uninsured vehicle on Indian roads is an offence. This is why liability insurance is also known as ‘Act Only’ plan. However, the scope of cover doesn’t include damage or loss of the insured vehicle.</p>
<h2><strong>Third-Party Liability Two Wheeler Insurance:</strong></h2>
<p>Third Party <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/motor-insurance/">Motor Insurance</a> in India is mandatory by law for all the registered vehicles that are plying on the roads. This rule applies for two-wheelers as well. Non-compliance may lead to the enforcement of legal punishment, which includes hefty fines, and trial under the laws of road safety under the Motor Vehicles Act.

<h2><strong>Step-wise Process of Claiming Third Party Insurance</strong></h2>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 1- Application:</strong></p>
<p>The victim or the legal envoy of the departed can make an application against the owner of the vehicle for a third-party liability compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2- Lodge an FIR</strong></p>
<p>Once the application is completed, file an FIR with the police, furnishing the required details. You must have a copy of the FIR and the original records of the expenses incurred by the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3- Approach the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal.</strong></p>

<p>NOTE: The police complaint must have the following information:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Driver’s Licence Number</li>

<h2><strong>Comprehensive V/s Third Party Liability Car Insurance</strong></h2>
<p>When you meet with a road accident, whom do you blame?</p>
<p>Do you blame yourself, the careless driver or the roads filled with potholes, or hard luck? Nobody takes the charge or no one wants to pay out-of-the-pocket. That's where a comprehensive &amp; third party car insurance policy comes to your rescue and acts as a Savior!</p>
<p>When you already accept the importance of owning car insurance, the next question that immediately comes to your mind is, "What kind of car insurance should I choose?"</p>
<p>Let us help you!</p>
<p>Car insurance can be classified into two types: Third-party Car Insurance and Comprehensive Car Insurance.</p>
<p>As you already know, Third-party car insurance protects you from any liability claimed by a third party due to injury or property damage in an accident. Without this cover, you are not allowed to ply your vehicle on roads. Comprehensive car insurance is quite extensive in nature. It safeguards your vehicle from natural and man-made calamities. Any damage to your car due to vandalism, earthquake, flood, storm, strike, riot, terrorist attack, or theft etc. will be taken care of by this plan. While third party insurance only covers third party liability, Comprehensive insurance covers the insured for own damage as well as third party liability. That’s the reason, mostly the experts recommend this insurance plan to ensure optimum protection. Here are the benefits for which, the comprehensive plan appears more appealing:</p>
