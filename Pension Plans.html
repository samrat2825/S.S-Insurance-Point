<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Types of Pension Plans in India</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pension plans are way better <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/investment-plans/articles/best-investment-options-in-india/">investment options that ensure</a> secure life after retirement. These plans have multiple classifications, based on the plan structure and benefits.These plans can be further divideded-</p>
<p>1. Deferred Annuity <br />2. Immediate Annuity<br />3. Annuity Certain<br />4. With Cover and Without Cover Pension Plans<br />5. Guaranteed Period Annuity<br />6. Life Annuity<br />7. National Pension Scheme (NPS)<br />8. Pension Funds</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deferred Annuity:</strong> A deferred <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/pension-plans/articles/nps-national-pension-scheme-all-you-need-to-know/">pension scheme</a> allows you to accumulate a corpus through regular premiums or single premium over a policy term. After the policy term is over, the pension will begin. The advantages of deferred pension plans are immense and these include tax benefits that are associated with this pension scheme. No tax is levied on the money that an individual invests in the plan unless he withdraws it. As deferred pension scheme can be bought by making the one-time payment or by making regular contributions towards it, therefore, the plan suits to all types of investors: those who want to invest systematically and those who have a chunk of money to invest.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Annuity:</strong> In an immediate annuity scheme, pension begins immediately. One has to deposit a lump-sum amount and pension will start instantly,basedon the lump-sum amountinvested by the policyholder. A range of the annuity options is available to choose from.Moreover, the premiums paid are exempted for tax, as per Income Tax Act, 1961.After the death of a policyholder, his nominee will be entitled to get money.</p>
<p><strong>With Cover and Without Cover Pension Plans:</strong>The "with cover" pension plans have life cover component in the plan. This implies that on the death of the policyholder, a lump sum amount is paid to the family members. However, the cover amount is not very high since a large part of premium is diverted towards growing the corpus rather than covering for life risk. The "without cover" pension plan implies that there is no life cover. In the event of unfortunate death of the policyholder, the nominee will get the corpus (till the date of the death). Currently, deferred pension plans are "with cover" and immediate annuity plans are "without cover".</p>
<p><strong>Annuity Certain:</strong>As per this clause, the annuity is paid to the annuitant for a specific number of years. The annuitant can choose the period and if he dies before exhausting all payments, the annuity will be paid to the beneficiary.</p>
<p><strong>Guaranteed Period Annuity:</strong>As per this annuity option, annuity is given to the life assured for certain periods like 5,10,15 or 20 years, whether or not he survives that duration.</p>
<p><strong>Life Annuity:</strong>As per this annuity option, pension amount will be paid to the annuitant until death. After choosing the “with spouse” option, the amount of pension will be given to the spouse of the policyholder, in case of the death of the annuitant.</p>
<p><strong>National Pension Scheme (NPS):</strong>New Pension scheme has been introduced by the government for people looking to build up pension amount. You can put savings in the new pension scheme which will be invested in equity and debt market as per your preference. You can withdraw 60% of the amount at retirement and rest 40% must be used to purchase the annuity. The maturity amount is not tax-free.</p>
<p><strong>Pension Funds:</strong>In a way, investing in a pension plan is a good option indeed. As these plans remain in force for a long time, they offer comparatively better returns at maturity. Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), the government body has allowed 6 companies as fund managers. </p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Features of Pension Plans</strong></span></h2>
<p>Nowadays, people start planning for the retirement life at an early stage so that at a later stage they do not have to depend on others to make their ends meet. Usually, a conventional pension plan encompasses following features-</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #135cae; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;">Annuity</span></strong></h3>
<p>The annuity is the most distinctive feature of pension plans and generally comes in two types, immediate and deferred. As its name suggests, immediate annuity starts immediately. The insurance company pays the annuitant the annuity pension plan amount right after the receipt of the lump sum premium. These plans offer the single premium route so that the insurance company can use the amount invested by the annuitant to build up a corpus for him or her. The deferred annuity plans are the normal plans that start paying a certain sum after a few years. The insurance companies offer a diverse range of pension plans for various terms that allow the annuitant to choose the period for which they want to receive the annuity. If you are thinking of retirement planning then look for the best pension plan in India by looking at the annuity they offer vis-a-vis the premium you will pay.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #135cae; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;">Sum Assured</span></strong></h3>
<p>The sum assured is the life insurance cover that the insured receives during the tenure of the pension plan. It gives the insured the benefit of being able to provide for his dependents if the worst comes to pass. The sum assured is generally given as a part of the ‘with cover’ pension plans. Such type of retirement pension plans give the mental peace necessary to carry on life without any worries. The life insurance companies in India calculate the sum assured in different ways. For instance, a few of them may offer pension plans with sum assured of say 10 times the premium amount, while others may provide a sum assured that equals the fund value of the policy taken by the individual. The calculation varies from company to company. In case, there is no sum assured, then the plan is more in the nature of pure play pension plan rather than an insurance plan with retirement benefits.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #135cae; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;">Vesting Age</span></strong></h3>
<p>The vesting age is the age when the investor starts receiving the pension income. Depending on when the policy was brought and the type of premium, the vesting age can be your current age if you opt for the pension plan payment to start right away (immediate annuity - lump sum premium) or after a few years such as 10-15 years. The minimum vesting age for most policies start from 40 years of age but on an average is around 50 years. The maximum vesting age is generally around 70 years, though some insurance companies may offer plans that have a maximum vesting age of 65 years or even 79 years or more.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #135cae; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;">Accumulation Period</span></strong></h3>
<p>This refers to the period when the premium is being paid by the investor for the pension plans. Some of the best pension plans in India offer the option to the investor to start paying off a part of the premium from any amounts due to be received by them. This decreases the outgo for the investor during the years leading up to retirement and helps them use their money on more urgent matters. However, most pension plans keep the accumulation period separate from the pay-out period. This helps in building up a significant corpus for the investor to receive a pension.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #135cae; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;">Payment Period</span></strong></h3>
<p>The payment period, as the name suggests, refers to the period in which the investor starts receiving the payments. This period is generally separate from the accumulation phase and helps the investor to increase his overall retirement corpus.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #135cae; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;">Surrender Value</span></strong></h3>
<p>The surrender value of pension plans is the amount the insurance company will pay the individual if they opt to surrender the pension plan before its due date, and if they have paid the premium for the required minimum period. Though people may need to surrender a plan for various reasons, including not being able to continue with the premium payment or needing the money, most experts suggest not surrendering a retirement plan due to the loss the individual will face. When the insured party chooses to surrender a pension plan, they lose all benefits attached to the plan, including the life cover, if any. Readers must note that the surrender value is a term associated only with insurance plans that have a savings corpus creation feature. The plans that do not have a savings component such as term plans do not have a surrender value. </p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #135cae; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3em;">Minimum Guarantee of Pension Plans</span></strong></h3>
<p>Every pension plan needs to have a minimum guarantee. Each premium paid towards the insurance policy as well as the maturity benefits must have “on zero returns”, as instructed by IRDA. This should be no less than one percent of the premiums paid over the years. Though the minimum guarantee extends to all variable insurance plans, most of the companies offer various types of other pension plans that may offer better returns than the guaranteed plans. This, of course, varies from plan to plan and you should make sure that you pick ones that makes sense to you. What the minimum guarantee of pension plans offers you is awareness of the amount that you will definitely receive at the end of the policy period.</p>
<h2><strong>Factors to Consider While Buying Pension Plans</strong></h2>
<p>Besides the type of pension plans, there are many different factors that should be considered while purchasing a pension plan are:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Monthly Expenses-</strong> while planning for retirement, it is very important to keep in mind the monthly expenses. After retirement, the regular source of income is cut-off. Thus, in order to maintain the regular monthly expenses of the family, it important to create a financial corpus big enough to take care of all these expenses. Apart from the monthly expenses, it is important to allocate ample fund for the post-retirement activities.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation-</strong> while purchasing a pension plan, it important to keep in mind the growing inflation rate and plan accordingly that how much corpus will be sufficient enough to maintain a financially secured lifestyle after retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Life Expectancy-</strong> there is no way through which you can predict how long an individual will live. Thus, while purchasing the best pension plans your retirement fund should be sufficient enough to support your financial needs at the time of old age.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Expenses</strong>- Young people often tend to ignore the future medical expenses. However, when you get old, you may end up spending excessive money on medical check-ups and treatments. Thus, it is very important that your pension plan should provide you with an adequate fund to deal with any type of medical emergencies.</li>
<li><strong>Assets and Loans-</strong> another important thing that you should consider while purchasing the best pension plans is your outstanding loans and current assets. In case you have any outstanding loans then pay off these loans while being in service. If you fail to pay these loans on time then it can take away a chunk of the annuity income.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to Calculate the Return of Pension Plans?</strong></h2>
<p>First, it is important to strategically invest your money and make savings for your retirement years. Savings is important and investment should be done in equity market well in advance if you decide to retire early. However, the best idea is to diversify your investment into</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Unit Linked Insurance Plans</li>
<li>Equity Market</li>
<li>Fixed Assets</li>
<li>FD &amp; Bonds</li>
<li>Pension Plans</li>
</ul>
<p>This will help you to generate regular income. These types of investments in best pension plans should be done well in advance from the age of 25-27. If you start planning for such investment at the age of 25, then you will notice that when you attain the age of retirement you will have more than crores as a fixed asset and liquid money.</p>
<h3><strong>The Detailed Retirement Calculation </strong></h3>
<p>For Example: Let us assume that your age of 27 and want to retire at the age of 45. So, you have 18 years in hand to make planning for retirement. You expect to live for 80 years. Based on these figures, the total corpus with the monthly income you require now would be:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Currently total investment and savings - 10000000/-</li>
<li>Estimated life expectancy - 80 years</li>
<li>Expected retirement age - 45</li>
<li>Current Age - 27</li>
<li>The expected annual rate of return - 10 %</li>
<li>Current monthly expenses - 40000</li>
<li>Expected monthly expenses - 50000</li>
<li>Inflation rate - 7.5%</li>
</ul>
<p>With the help of the <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/financial-tools-calculators/pension-calculator/">online pension calculator</a> you will come to know the monthly savings you need currently, the total sum required and monthly expenses required for the retirement years.</p>
<p>If you will estimate based on the above table, you will need 1,00,87,666/- total corpus to retire early at the age of 45. If you will invest smartly in pension funds in India and make great savings during your working years you can easily save from your earnings the required corpus for your retirement years. If you live for 75-80, which means 25 years after retirement, then you will have income coming from your fixed assets and other investments. Along with the inflation, the income coming from the investments will also increase simultaneously which would be sufficient for you to lead a luxury life after your retirement at 45.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Tips to Choose the Right Pension Plan</strong></span></h2>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Understand your needs:</strong> It is crucial that you understand how much you need to sustain yourself and your dependents after you retire. Make allowance for the inflation and thus, the increased expenses in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Do some research:</strong> Read through the pension details in depth to understand what you are opting for. Some policies will explain in the pension details the type of income you are likely to receive. Look up your needs from your retirement planning calculations and pick the plans that make sense. The pension details in the policies will offer information on the periodicity of your income, how much is guaranteed, how much is dependent on market performance etc.</li>
<li><strong>Understand the different products:</strong> There are a large number of retirement solutions in the market. Choose the ones that can give you the income you need. You can know this number from your retirement planning calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Know about other retirement planning options:</strong> Do not stick to a retirement planning solution just because someone says so. One product that suits your friend may not suit you. Look up the provident funds, the pension plans offered by the asset management companies and those offered by the insurance companies to get what you need.</li>
<li><strong>Do not look at only the tax benefits:</strong> Though tax benefits matter, they form only a part of the overall picture. If you plan for your retirement, considering only the tax benefits, you may not be able to build up the corpus you need for your retirement. So, do your retirement planning calculations and invest the amount you know you should get a secure future.</li>

<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Eligibility for Retirement Plans in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>The three main aspects that play the major role are while planning to purchase retirement plans in India are:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Entry Age:</strong> You can purchase a pension plan only after you attain a certain age. There are different age brackets for different insurance providers, but the minimum age to take a pension plan that most of the companies offer are - 18 years. However, there are some companies that allow an individual to be at least 30 years before taking a retirement plans in India. In the same way, there is an upper limit on the entry age of the pension plans and in most of the cases, it is around 70 years.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Premium:</strong> There is a minimum premium requirement for taking a pension plan. This is because the pension is received according to the premium selected and paid by you.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vesting Age:</strong> This is the age at which you start getting a pension. This age can start from 40 years and go up to the limit provided by the insurance provider. However, the minimum vesting age can also vary.</li>

<h2><a><strong>Budget wish list: Push for pension plans, zero GST on term policies</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In the latest budget released by the Indian Government, it announced the launch of term policies with zero GST, which will encourage people to buy term policies, and hence, eventually help the country to have a better GDP percentage for life insurance schemes. As annuity schemes in India have always been taxable, they have always been considered as an unattractive investment option. The government has thus, made a big move to make term insurance plans available at zero GST or at a minimum rate of 5% to deepen financial inclusion amongst the middle-class investors. There isn’t also much attention focussed towards the health &amp; protection needs of the middle and lower income class individuals. Allowing tax deduction provisions for life &amp; health insurance schemes under Section 80 will help address the needs of this class, which forms a major chunk of the country’s population.</div>

<h2><a><strong>Budget 2018: PMVVY Limit to Increase to 15 Lakh</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Under budget 2018, the Finance Minister of India has proposed the extension of scheme Pradhanmantri Vaya Vandana Yojana(PMVVY) till March, 2020. Moreover, it has also been proposed by the FM that the current limit of investment will increase to Rs 15 lakh from the pre-existing limit of Rs 7.5 lakh for every senior citizen. PMVVY is a government backed pension scheme that was introduced to secure the future of senior citizens in India. The scheme was launched on May 4th 2017 and was initially available for 1 year. The amount invested in PMVVY is known as purchase price. As per the pension plan option chosen by an individual i.e. (monthly, quarterly, yearly), the pension is provided as arrears starting from the end of the period chosen. Based on the amount invested, the maximum tenure of the policy is 10 years. The increase in the investment limit is proved to be beneficial to seniors.</div>

<h2><a><strong>TATA Steel Backed New Pension Plan to Be Joined By a Large Number of UK Workers</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">A throng of 1,22,000 workers have signed a deal to switch to a new pension scheme backed by TATA Steel UK after they were affected by the end of the 15 billion pound pension scheme. According to the reports, it has been confirmed that approximately 97,000 members have indicated their shift from British English Pension Scheme to the New Plan by returning their option form, whereas, just 14% of the members chose to stick with the old pension scheme.

Among which 97,000 members filled the forms completely and returned them. TATA Steel UK has welcomed the outcome of the conference conducted as a positive choice. However, the spokesperson of the company has stated that much work is still required to deliver a secure future for their UK business.</div>

<h2><a><strong>Budget 2018 and the Financial Aid for Senior Citizens</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In his Budget speech 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley focused on caring for the senior citizens. He announced various tax &amp; related incentives to decrease the fiscal burden on people above 60 years of age and above. All these moves are very welcome since senior-citizens face rising health-care expenses and depend upon their income earned from interest &amp; pension. From affording a 5-fold increment in the tax exemption limit on income earned from savings, recurring deposits and fixed deposits held with post offices and banks of Rs.50, 000, to eliminating the tax deducted at source on this income, budget 2018 offers well-deserved relief to senior citizens. This is done by leaving a more money in the hands of senior citizens savers who are totally dependent on earned interest to meet their day to day expenses. Another tax change is the offer to increase the yearly tax deduction limit for medical insurance premium or/and medical reimbursement to Rs. 50,000 for the elderly. An applause-worthy step is setting the ceiling for tax deduction for medical costs incurred on specific critical diseases to Rs. 1 lakh, regardless of the age of the senior citizen.</div>

<h2><a><strong>The Central Government Unwinds Atal Pension Plan Norms</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Payment banks and small finance banks can now offer the Atal Pension Yojana or APY. The Central government believes that such a move will considerably increase the coverage of the plan. The government is of the opinion that these banks will strengthen the current distribution channels of the APY scheme. As per the Ministry of Finance, this step will further help in boosting outreach to subscribers under the scheme. As of now, ten small finance banks and eleven payment banks have obtained licenses from RBI to initiate banking operations in India. Participation in Atal Pension Yojana helps in building a pensioned society and also provides viable fee revenue to banks by way of alluring incentives for mobilizing the scheme at the rate of Rs 120 to 150 per account.  As per government reports, by the end of January 2018, more than 84 lakh subscriptions were registered under the scheme.</div>

<h2><a><strong>Indians Best at Retirement Planning: Survey, 2017 </strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Indians resumed their position of best placed in retirement planning in a global survey conducted by Aegon Retirement Readiness Index (ARRI), in 2017. The superannuation survey was done among 15 countries. Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey 2017, was based on 6 parameters including - personal responsibility of the respondents, mindfulness, financial understanding and responsibilities, retirement planning, and income replacement. ARRI said that the report is not illustrative of the general population and is directed towards the medium and high-income earners across these cities. India ranks the highest on the ARRI score index with 7.6 score, among the 15 major economies of the world. US, Brazil, China and UK follow the trail with a score of 6.9, 6.4, 6.3 and 6.2 respectively. Spain (4.7) and Japan (5.1) scored the lowest on the index.</div>

<h2><a><strong>SeLFIES for India</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In a major decision taken by the Indian Government, it has decided to allocate a total of Rs 50 lakh crore for the infrastructure, in the budget released for the current financial year. At the same time, there are also certain provisions introduced in the budget to improve the life of retirees/senior citizens. “A life of dignity” comes with the confidence to ensure the income security of senior citizens in India. SelFIES (Standard of Living indexed, Forward-starting, Income-only Securities) is a long-term bond introduced to help retirees lead their pre-retirement lifestyle even after their retirement. Most of the times, part-time employees, people from low-income group, rural workers, etc. can’t save enough for their retirement due to the obvious lack of funds. SeLFIES will give them access to invest in low-cost, safe and liquid bonds issued by the Indian Government. Financial literacy rate in India is still relatively low; hence, SeLFIES is a welcoming change that will allow people to access their funds when they actually need it, eventually simplifying the process of retirement planning.</div>

<h2><a><strong>Plea against pension for ‘freedom fighter’</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In a latest statement released by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the Madurai Bench has favoured an appeal to grant freedom fighter pension to a senior citizen. Earlier, the claimant, Govindarajulu, 91 years of age, was denied pension based on the fact that he was not able to fulfil the specified eligibility criteria for the requirement. According to the set criteria to claim freedom fighter’s pension, the claimant should already have attained the age of 18 at the time of her or his imprisonment. Also, s/he is required to submit a copy of jail records by the authorized committee. In an earlier judgement, Govindarajulu was denied pension, stating that he wasn’t able to submit relevant documents to specify his date of birth. In its statement, the Madras High Court has expressed regrets and apologized for the state’s insensitive approach toward the whole matter. In the latest statement released, Justice K Ravichandra Babu chided the system for its ‘bureaucratic dogmatism” and said that pension facility for freedom fighters is not a charity done by the government, but is a bestowal of honour for those who fought for our freedom. In the judgement released by the Madras High Court, the Tamil Nadu Government has been ordered to grant the pension for Govindarajulu in two weeks.</div>

<h2><a><strong>A Panel to Analyze Pension plan</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Kerala state government is to appoint a ‘committee’ to analyze the socio-economic &amp; legal significance of the CPS (Contributory Pension Scheme). The committee will analyze the effects of 2 facets of the CPS: the transfer of states’ funds to (private) fund managers and the co-occurring existence of 2 schemes in the state- the statutory schemes and the contributory schemes. An announcement was made by finance minister of Kerala Dr. T M Thomas Isaac in a reply to a Calling Attention motion put forward by MLA Mullakkara Ratnakaran. Mr. Ratnakaran demanded the establishment of a ‘commission’ for studying pension plans. Dr. Isaac has accepted Mr. Ratnakaran’s demand for specifying a time-duration for the committee to present its report. The committee members and schedule are yet to be announced later. As per the contributory pension scheme, a government employee contributes a decided percentage of his/her basic salary, it is then combined with the dearness allowance and an equal portion is contributed by the government.  A pension fund manager will be entrusted with the same. The fund manager will invest the money in the shares and mutual funds.</div>

<h2><a><strong>Sale of Traditional Pension Plans Increase Owing to recent market fluctuation</strong></a></h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Looking at the fluctuations in the equity market, Indians have now started opting for traditional pension plans as well as life insurance plans <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/ulip-plans/" rel="alternate">instead of ULIPs</a>. As reported by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, people are now inclined more towards life insurance policies such as life insurance (67.8% of products in the market were purchased). Moreover, 18.6% pension plans were purchased in the financial year 2015-16. The sales of these products have increased as compared to year-on-year sale.
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sales of ULIPs have gone down, and its contribution to the insurance pool has slipped from 16.1% (2014-15) to 13.6% (2015-16). Out of Rs. 25 lakh crore invested by life insurance policies, only Rs. 3.4 lakh crore was from ULIPs. The traditional products have a major share in the current market. In this sector, life funds contributed Rs 16.9 lakh crore. Moreover, Rs 4.6 lakh crore was the contribution of the pension funds.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Provident Fund (PF) scheme was launched by the Government of India in 1968 to create a pan India scheme for the citizens for their retirement planning. Any Indian above the age of 18 years can open the PF account and deposit amounts from as low as Rs. 500 to Rs. 1.5 lakh per year. The <a href="../../../../income-tax/ppf-interest-rate/">PF interest rate</a> is compounded over its 15 years tenure to build up a large retirement corpus base for the individual. It has a lock-in period of 7 years and allows the investors to make withdrawals from the eight year onwards, though withdrawal of all the funds is allowed only after the maturity period. The plan can be renewed beyond the initial 15 years for additional periods of 5 years each.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) is a provident fund and insurance scheme administered by the Government of India for all employees of various organisations across the country. The provident fund requires employees of a member organisation to make a contribution of 12% of their income towards the fund along with an equal contribution by their employers. The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation that manages the fund invests most of the amounts received from employees in debt securities though the Government allows 5% to 15% to be invested in the stock market.<br /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Employees&rsquo; Pension Scheme (EPS) is a completely different scheme but which is interrelated with the Employees' Provident Fund, both being managed under the Employees&rsquo; Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952. The Employees&rsquo; Provident Fund Organisation diverts 8.33% of the 12% salary contribution that the employers have made for their employees&rsquo; EPF into the employees&rsquo; EPS accounts. The 12% contribution that the employees have made from their own salary stays in the EPF.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The National Pension Scheme or the New Pension Scheme is a Government of India initiative to give policyholders a pension plan that will take care of them at old age. The retirement planning becomes easier with the new pension scheme as the pensioners receive a pension depending on their contribution towards the pension plan during the accumulation stage. The voluntary new pension scheme in India is managed by the Pension Fund Regulatory &amp; Development Authority that was set up by an act of the Indian Parliament in 2013.&nbsp;<br /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new pension scheme is a voluntary scheme that is open to all people in the age group of 18 to 60 years. It seeks to inculcate a discipline of savings among Indians to take care of their future. The <a href="../../../../life-insurance/pension-plans/articles/new-pension-scheme/">new pension scheme contribution</a> starts with Rs. 500 per month or Rs. 6,000 per year. There is no limit on the maximum contribution, though. The Income Tax Act allows a deduction of only Rs. 50,000 under section 80CCD (1B).<br /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new pension scheme provides a range of benefits such as the option to select from a range of investment choices and to choose the pension fund manager of one&rsquo;s choice. The new pension scheme also allows individuals to switch between&nbsp;different investment options&nbsp;and also between different fund managers.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The participating pension plans are also called the traditional type of insurance plans, since the bonus in these products are similar to the reversionary bonuses of the standard insurance policies. In traditional plans, the insurance company offers the insured a bonus that is a percentage of the sum assured of their policy. This bonus is generally declared by the insurance company each year based on its performance in the previous year. The reversionary bonus is generally of the nature of simple interest where the bonus of the previous period does not get added to the sum assured. These bonuses declared in the tenure of the retirement policy get accumulated and the lump sum amount distributed to the insured party when the policy matures. The participating pension scheme in India allows for a planned approach to retirement planning.<br /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The non-participating plans declare their bonus amounts at the time of the investor signing up for the plan. The insurance company has no discretion in non-participating pension plans and have to deliver on the amounts promised under the pension plan. Most of the <a href="../../../../life-insurance/pension-plans/articles/top-10-pension-plans/">top pension plans in India</a> offer retirement benefits or bonuses that are pegged to certain indices. These may be the larger market index or smaller indices comprising of a few securities or government bonds. The non-participating plans offer more definite returns and make it easier for people to do their retirement planning.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Pension Plans can be classified on various parameters. Here On the basis of mode of premium payment</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deferred Annuity Pension Plan</strong> - The premium is paid regularly on a monthly/quarterly/annual basis. The annuity begins after a time period as specified by the policyholder in the annuity contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Immediate Annuity Pension Plan</strong> - A lump sum is paid as a one-time premium and the annuity begins almost immediately and continues for the policy term or throughout the insured&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>On the basis of nature of investment</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ULIP Pension Plans</strong> - The pool of funds created by the premiums of the insured persons is invested both in debt instruments and equity instruments. Since it&rsquo;s a market linked plan, the potential for returns is high.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Traditional Pension Plans</strong> - The pool of funds created by the premiums of the insured persons is invested only in debt instruments. The returns are steady but not substantial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>On the basis of tenure</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Life annuity Pension Plan</strong> - The annuity is paid out to the insured until his/her death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fixed Term Annuity Pension Plan - The annuity is paid out to the insured until a fixed term (decided by the policyholder). The term could be quite earlier than the insured&rsquo;s death.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the right annuity plan can bring major changes to your retirement income. Nowadays, many people consider buying annuity pension plans as the part of their retirement option. Annuity plans can be broadly categorized into immediate annuity plan and deferred annuity plan. To know which retirement plan you should choose it is important to learn more about these plans:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deferred Annuity Plan</strong>: Under this plan, annuity phase is preceded by saving phase. Such types of policies are designed for people who don't require immediate pensions and have several years till the retirement age. It means they have enough time to invest and build a corpus. All premiums which are paid get invested till the maturity date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Immediate Annuity Plan</strong>: In immediate annuity plan, if you are above 30 years, you can pay a lump sum amount and then start earning annuity benefits immediately after retirement. The payments can either be scheduled for a fixed tenure like 5, 10 or 15 years. Here, it is important to mention that immediate annuity plans are non-participating products and thus, they don't earn bonuses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can choose any of the above plans based on your risk appetite, fund requirement and current annual income.</p>                </div>
