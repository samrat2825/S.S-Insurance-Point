<h2>Key Features of Travel Insurance Policies in India</h2>
</div>
<p>The basic purpose of travel insurance is to allow the insured to enjoy every moment of their trip by taking care of any unforeseen expenses while traveling. If you are wondering what are the qualities of the best travel insurance India has available, take a look at some of its features:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong><b>Emergency Hospitalization &amp; Medical Treatment - </b></strong>Nobody can rule out the possibility of a medical emergency while traveling. By insuring your trip, you can stay assured as all your hospitalization and treatment expenses will be taken care of by your insurer.</li>
<li><strong><b>Compensation for Flight-Related Adversities - </b></strong>Facing any adversities related to your flight is very common and chances of facing it increase if you are traveling abroad. Whether there has been a flight delay leading to a missed connecting flight or your check-in baggage has been lost or delayed by your airline, your travel insurer will compensate for the losses you have incurred.</li>
<li><strong><b>Cashless Hospitalization Facility - </b></strong>A travel insurance policy also comes with cashless medical treatment facilities. If you get hospitalized or are availing medical treatment at an impaneled hospital of your insurer, you can receive cashless service in which all your medical bills will be settled directly by your insurer. You would not have to pay up the hospital for any covered treatment.</li>
<li><strong><b>Customized Plans for Senior Citizens - </b></strong>The travel needs of senior citizens are way different from the needs of other kinds of travelers. Taking cognizance of this fact, most insurance companies offer customized trip insurance policies for elderly people who are traveling within India or abroad   </li>
<li><strong><b>Available for Frequent Flyers - </b></strong>Buying insurance for each trip can turn out to be pretty expensive for people who travel frequently or multiple times in a year. To ensure that such frequent flyers enjoy the perks of trip insurance on each trip without spending a fortune, insurance providers offer multi-trip travel insurance policies with a year-long validity.</li>
</ul>

For instance, senior citizen travel insurance has been custom-made to protect the elderly while traveling. You should select a plan according to the age of all travelers.</li>
<li><strong><b>Sum Insured Amount - </b></strong>The sum insured amount is directly proportional to the premium cost. The trip insurance plans with higher sum insured draw higher premiums. However, you must choose a sum insured amount that adequately covers your needs in case of an unforeseen incident.</li>
<li><strong><b>Coverage Offered - </b></strong>Compare and analyze the different coverage provided by various travel insurers while selecting a plan. Choose a plan that protects you from most of the risks that you may face during your trip abroad.</li>

Choose a plan that suits your destination.</li>
<li><strong><b>Trip Duration - </b></strong>The duration of your trip plays a major role in estimating your premium amount. The longer the travel, the higher the insurance premium will get. Choose a plan that charges a lesser premium for the total duration of your trip.</li>
<li><strong><b>Claim Settlement Ratio of the Insured - </b></strong>Before buying an insurance policy for your trip, you should check the claim settlement ratio of the different insurance companies. A company with a higher claim settlement ratio has settled more claims and thus should be preferred while buying travel insurance online.</li>

A company that enjoys goodwill in the market can be considered reliable and will settle the claims on time.</li>
<li><strong><b>Affordability - </b></strong>The best policy is the one that provides the maximum coverage at minimum cost. Make sure to choose a policy that is economical but provides all crucial covers.</li>
<li><strong><b>Hassle-free Claim Procedure - </b></strong>While choosing an insurance policy for your trip, find out about the claim procedures of different plans. A policy with a complicated claim procedure will be more of a hassle at the time of settling a claim. You should choose the insurer with the quickest and the most convenient claim process.</li>
<li><strong><b>Solvency Ratio - </b></strong>You should also check the solvency ratio of an insurance provider before buying an insurance policy. A company with a goodsolvency ratio reflects its sound financial standing and has lesser chances of going bankrupt.</li>

<h3><a>Thailand likely to make Travel Insurance Compulsory</a></h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">If you’re planning to travel to Thailand in the future, you might need to purchase a special travel insurance plan once you land in the country. According to reports, Thailand is likely to make travel insurance mandatory for visitors to the country. This would be implemented most likely later in 2019. All the earnings and profits from the plan will go to the Tourism Promotion Fund of Thailand that will be used to cover payments in the event of a claim. However, this would be implemented after getting approval from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports. You can purchase this policy at the immigration office at the Thailand airports that would offer a cover of up to 1 M baht (Rs. 23,50,850) in the event of death.</div>

Your travel insurer lends you a helping hand and takes care of all your emergency needs including medical and non-medical expenses including personal liability, flight delay, baggage loss, etc. If you travel without getting your trip insured, you can end up paying way more than the premium amount.</p>                </div>
