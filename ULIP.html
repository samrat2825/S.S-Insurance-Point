                <h1 itemprop="name">ULIP(Unit Linked Insurance Plan)</h1>
                <p>A Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is a hybrid life insurance product that provides life insurance cover, investment opportunities and tax saving benefits under section 80C of the Income Tax Act.</p>
<div class="icon-div"><span class="sprite_content what-is-ulip" title="What is ulip plan">icon</span>
<h2 class="heading-wid-icon">What is ULIP?</h2>
</div>
<p>ULIP Plan is a life insurance product that offers risk cover for the insured together with investment options to invest in some qualified investments like mutual funds, bonds, and stocks. As one integrated plan, the protection part and the investment part can be managed depending on the specific choices and needs.</p>
<p><a class="single_image" href="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/Home/ulip-infographic.jpg"><img class="banner" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: right;" src="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/Home/ulip-plan-tips.jpg" alt="What is ULIP" width="320" /></a>In these plans, the investments are subjects to the risks associated with the capital market. The policyholder bears the investment risk on his/her investment portfolio. Hence, it is recommended to make an investment choice basis the needs along with the risk appetite.</p>
<p>Another factor that has to be taken into consideration by the policyholder is the future needs of the invested funds. Moreover, a unit linked plan is much more transparent. The charges including fund management charges, allocation charges etc. are clearly stated upfront.</p>
<p>Unit Linked Insurance Plan also allows its investors to switch their investment from debt to equity and vice-versa, without running from pillar to post and any worries of being charged.</p>
<p>ULIP plans were first introduced in India by Unit Trust of India (UTI) in 1971. This was followed by ULIP offerings from Life Insurance Corporation in 1989. Initially, a lot of investors shied away from investing in ULIPs due to the high charges associated with this insurance-investment product. However, in the recent times, major life insurance providers including Bajaj Life, HDFC, ICICI Pru, and Edelweiss Tokio came out with new-age ULIP products with bare minimal charges and multiple features to ensure maximum returns and comprehensive insurance protection for the investors.</p>
<p>In 2018, Union Finance Ministry reintroduced Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) taxes on equity-linked mutual fund schemes. Soon after the announcement, a large majority of life insurance companies started offering new-age ULIP plans as an alternative for equity-linked mutual fund schemes. In no time, ULIP plans started ranking alongside the most sought after investment instruments for investors with different risk appetite and budget.</p>

<h2>How to Choose the Best ULIP plan in India?</h2>
<p>There are some things that an investor should keep in mind while choosing the best ULIP plans in India. Here’s a list of some pointers to consider while buying one:</p>
<h3><strong>Analysis of Personal Investment Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Before choosing a ULIP plan; it is a pre-condition for an every investor to analyse their long-term fiscal goals. It is mandate to opt for a ULIP that is in sync with the investment horizon and the investment goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Decide Insurance Objectives</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One should first decide the insurance objectives and then select a ULIP plan that fulfils them. If one is young, current as well as future family requirements need to be considered because the insurance cover should be adequate if something happens to the insured. Family planning, i.e. the number of children one plans to have is an important consideration. It is imperative to understand that ULIP is a long-term investment product. Therefore, one should be clear about the investment and insurance objectives when putting money in a unit linked insurance plan to get the maximum benefit from the investment.</p>
<h3><strong>Decide Investment Goals</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investment goals are extremely important. One should spend sufficient time and think before in deciding these goals. This exercise, if done well, makes the process of choosing unit linked insurance plan easy. Investment goals may vary from having a corpus for the higher education requirements of the children after some years to having sizeable funds for the child’s marriage. They may also include having the requisite amount of money for post-retirement needs. Utmost importance should be given to one’s investment goals. Once these goals have been decided, one can look for ULIPs with their benefits which fulfil the goals adequately.</p>
<h3><strong>Compare</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the best ULIP plan becomes a cakewalk when the investor is aware of its different benefits and features of unit linked plans. The comparison can be done in the traditional offline way or online using one of the many online insurance comparison portals. The websites rank and compare plans of different insurance companies on parameters such as sum assured value, policy term, and different charges and bring to the fore, the many differences in a ULIP plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The investor can also make use of the ULIP Calculator to calculate the returns on the investment so as to make a well-informed and wise decision.</p>

<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Policy Tenure Flexibility:</strong> Many ULIP plans are long-term; resultantly, they tag along with a lock-in period 3 to 5 years.

</ul>
<h3><strong>Evaluate Risk Profile and Financial Stability</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to appraise one’s own risk profile and financial stability before choosing a unit linked insurance plan. Younger people who typically have higher risk appetite can go in for plans, which are more equity focussed to the extent of 100% equity allocation. Those people for whom financial stability is of prime importance will do well with a plan that primarily invests in debt instruments, which provide stability albeit with limited returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Understand Different Charges Levied</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While choosing a unit linked plan from the best ULIP plans available, understand the charges well. These include initial charges, premium allocation fee, fund management fee, surrender charges, mortality charges, and administration and service charges.

Having a proper understanding of the pros and cons of each plan makes the decision to choose a unit linked insurance plan easy. One is able to find a better fit based on personal requirements if the characteristics are understood well.</p>
<h3><strong>Check the Performance of the Plan</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finding out the performance of a ULIP plan under consideration is a good idea. One can refer to the performance of last three to four years. It gives a fair idea about returns that one can expect from the plan. The returns should also be compared to benchmark indices like the Nifty of the NSE and the Sensex of the BSE.</p>
<h2>Key Features of ULIPs</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ULIP plans come packed with a variety of features to aid the investors make sure fiscal security against all the future adversities, enjoy tax benefits, and maximise their financial corpus manifold.

<h3><strong>Funds for Crucial Milestones in Life</strong></h3>
<p>Significant amount of funds are required at different stages in life. They may be required for one’s business, building a house, child’s marriage, etc. The facility to partially withdraw money gives access to much-needed funds at critical stages to address important needs.

A part of the premium paid in a Unit Linked Insurance Plan in invested in funds, which invest in different market instruments including debt and equity in varying proportions.

<h3><strong>Death Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>A unit linked plan offers death benefits in case of the death of the insured during the policy term. While the death benefits are catered to as SA together with the value of the fund, benefits may differ based on the cause of demise of the insured.</p>
<h3><strong>Maturity Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>A ULIP plan also comes packed with maturity benefits in case the policyholder endures the maturity period of the plan. Usually, maturity benefits are catered to the insured as the sum of the value of the fund. Nevertheless, some insurance companies may cater to add-on benefits based on the terms and conditions.</p>
<h3><strong>Tax Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>On top of the insurance and investment benefits, Unit Linked Insurance Plan also offers tax exemption benefits for maximum of Rs. 1.5 Lakh u/s 80C of the IT Act, 1961. Moreover, the maturity benefits on ULIPs are also tax free. Nevertheless, there is a forewarning.

<h3><strong>Long-term Investment Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>A ULIP plan is one of the most sough-after investment instruments for the ones who are seeking to earn maximum returns on the investments they make in long-term.

A unit linked insurance plan allows for the long-term investments and make it simpler for the investors to reap the maximum returns on the investments.</p>
<h3><strong>Withdrawal Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>A unit linked insurance plan comes handy in such situations. A ULIP plan allows its investors to withdraw a portion of the investments in case of emergency, after the completion of a pre-determined timeline. Generally, such withdrawals are tax free.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Unit Linked Insurance Plan</h2>
<p>Apart from a bunch of benefits and features a ULIP plan has, there are various advantages of a ULIP plan. They are as follows:</p>
<h3><strong>Life Protection, Savings, and Investment</strong></h3>
<p>Unit Linked Insurance Plan offers the dual benefits of savings at the market-linked returns and life insurance. Hence, the policyholder has the opportunity to make investment to reap higher returns, while paying attention to the protection needs. Making investments in unit linked plans aids to inculcate a habit of investing and saving that is vital to build a financial corpus over a period of time.</p>
<h3><strong>Single Premium</strong></h3>
<p>The insured has to pay a premium as lump sum at the beginning of the term of the unit linked insurance plan.</p>
<h2>How do ULIPs work?</h2>
<p>In unit linked plans, one share of the paid premium towards the plan goes towards ensuring the life cover for the policyholder, whereas the other share of the paid premium is invested in various types of fund options. The investors can choose the fund options basis their wealth creation goals and risk appetite. In the event of the untimely and unfortunate demise of the policyholder, the nominated beneficiaries will be given the insurance and/or the fund value, whichever is higher, based on the type of unit linked insurance plan.</p>
<p>Much like the mutual funds, the insurance company will give the ‘Units’ basis the proportion of the investor’s money invested in the market. This unit is the representation of the investment and is allocated a NAV that is evaluated and declared daily.</p>
<p>In order to understand the working of these plans, here’s an example:</p>
<p>Akash, a 30 year old man, invests in unit linked insurance plan with a yearly premium of Rs. 50,000 for a period of 20 years. The policy essentials would be:</p>
<p><strong>Policy Details:</strong></p>
<p>Initial Sum Assured = Rs. 5,00,000 (yearly premium x 10)<br /> Annual Administration and other charges = Rs. 2500<br /> Total Annual Investment = Rs. 47,500<br /> Initial NAV Value = Rs. 10<br /> Units purchased = (47500/10) = 4750</p>
<p><strong>ULIP Returns:</strong></p>

<h2>Why to Invest in ULIP?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ULIP combines the benefits of insurance and investment in one financial instrument. In any case, they are better than insurance or investment alone. With the protection of a life insurance cover, they also provide the option to earn market linked returns to take care of important goals in life.</p>
<h3><strong><span lang="EN-IN">Higher Returns</span></strong></h3>
<p>ULIP plans come with higher returns. The investor can expect 12%-15% returns from his/he investment for tenure of 10 years. This is because ULIP offers various options to its investors like balanced funds, equity funds, or debt funds. Basis the risk appetite of the investor, s/he can choose one of the aforementioned options. ULIP allows switching between the funds, and by doing so an investor can obtain higher returns on the amount invested by them.</p>
<h3><strong>They Help Avoid the Everyday Hassle of Managing Stocks</strong></h3>
<p>One can invest in equity based market funds, which offer a higher rate of return as compared to debt funds. In addition to higher returns, one does not have to worry about monitoring the stocks every day. The insurance company and its fund managers take care of that. They also bring to the table, expertise in fund management. Policyholders can also easily keep a tab on their portfolio with simple tools such as the unit linked insurance plan NAV.</p>
<h3><strong>Multiple Fund Options to Choose From</strong></h3>
<p>ULIPs prove multiple fund options at ones disposal. One can choose the type of fund where the premiums will be invested. These can be fully debt or equity or a combination of the two in varying ratios. Looking the historical returns over the years as well as its NAV will make it easier to understand which the best ULIP plans are. Depending on one’s risk taking ability, changing life and financial situation, one may choose to switch the fund to best adjust to the new scenario. Equity focused funds are apt for people with higher risk appetite while debt focused funds are more suitable for risk-averse people who want guaranteed returns.</p>
<h3><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>
<p>One of the plus points of a ULIP plan is that it is an extremely transparent financial product. Unlike traditional plans where no information is shared with the policyholder, one is provided information about all the charges levied. From the easy to understand the NAV to the historical returns, the numbers help pick the best ULIP plans easily. In addition, one clearly knows where the current account stands.</p>
<h3><strong>Liquidity</strong></h3>
<p>Unit Linked Insurance Plan is a fairly liquid investment product. They offer partial withdrawal of money to meet unpredictable events and emergencies. Also, the NAV of each fund is generally displayed on the website of the insurance company. Checking the NAV numbers will help to easily align the investment and insurance cover with the overall needs.</p>
<h3><strong>Low Surrender Charges</strong></h3>
<p>Surrender charges are charges that one has to pay in case one is surrendering a policy. If one finds oneself in a situation where one is stuck with a plan that is no more suitable, one can bear the surrender charges and rid oneself of such a policy. The surrender charges are unbelievably high in case of traditional plans leaving one with only a small portion of money invested post exit. However, they are reasonable in the case of ULIPs.</p>
<h2>Types of ULIPs</h2>
<p>There are several types of ULIPs and they can be broadly categorised based on the needs and financial objective of the investor. Let us explore the types of unit linked insurance plans:</p>
<h3><strong>Classification by Purpose</strong></h3>
<p>ULIPs are best classified on the basis of purpose they serve:</p>
<p><strong>ULIP for Retirement: </strong>In this plan, the policyholders need to make the payment during their tenure with their employer, which is automatically collected in a corpus amount, which is paid in the form of annuities to a policyholder after retirement. Whole life ULIP schemes come loaded with systematic withdrawal option, which gives flexibility and tax free income.</p>

<h3><strong>Debt Funds</strong></h3>
<p>These are the funds where the investors invest the premium in debt instruments that carry a lower risk but offer lower returns.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Equity Funds</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Equity funds are the investment instruments where the investors invest the premium in the equity markets and hence are subject to higher risks.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Balanced Funds</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Balanced funds are the options where the premium is balanced between the equity market and the debt market to minimize the risks for investors.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Classification by Death Benefits</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unit linked insurance plans can also be categorised on different criteria or norms. For instance, ULIPs are categorised into two broad categories depending on the death benefit:</p>
<p><strong>Type 1 ULIP Plans</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In case of death of the policyholder, the nominee receives death benefit, which is equal to higher of the sum assured or fund value by the insurance company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mortality charge in type 1 unit linked insurance plan keeps on reducing every year as the sum at risk reduces. The sum at risk is the difference between the accumulated fund value and sum assured under the policy. In other words, it is the amount an insurance company pays from its own pocket in the event of the death of the policyholder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s understand this with the help of an example. Suppose, the insured took a ULIP plan with a sum assured of Rs. 50 lakh. He has paid the premium for 7 years and the fund value has now grown to Rs. 28 lakh. In the event of the death of the policyholder, the beneficiary will receive Rs. 50 lakh, the higher of sum assured (Rs. 50 lakh) or fund value (Rs. 28 lakh).</p>
<p><strong>Type 2 ULIP Plans</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a policyholder dies, the death benefit received by the nominee in case of type 2 ULIP is equal to sum assured plus fund value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing to note is that premiums for type 2 plans are higher than those for type 1 ULIP plans. A Type 2 ULIP plan also considers mortality rates with every policy year because the risk of death increases with age.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As above, let us look at an example to understand the concept better. Taking the above scenario where the insured has taken a unit linked plan with a sum assured of Rs. 50 lakh. And the policyholder has paid the premium for 7 years, which has resulted in fund value now standing at Rs. 28 lakh. In the event of the death of the policyholder, the beneficiary or nominee will receive Rs. 78 lakh, i.e. sum assured (Rs. 50 lakh) plus fund value (Rs. 28 lakh).</p>
<h2>ULIP Checklist: Things one should Care before Investing</h2>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>ULIP is a complex financial product. It comes in a lot of variants, each with its unique set of features and benefits. Buying it can be a mind-boggling process. However, if an investor will follow these simple steps, the process of choosing a right unit linked plan can become hassle-free.</li>
<li>It is always good to have the know-how of the working of a unit linked plan. Do the homework well and read as much as possible about unit linked plans before investing.</li>
<li>The investor should know charges levied on entry and exit of the policy.</li>
<li>The investors must keep their focus on their investment goals rather than getting swayed by some luring feature of a unit linked insurance plan. Identify a plan that best suits to their risk appetite and financial health. If an investor has a high-risk appetite, then s/he must opt for a high-risk high-return fund.</li>
<li>Carefully examine how the fund has performed in the past 2 to 3 years while the benchmarks remain indices like BSE or Nifty.</li>
<li>Compare ULIP products of different insurance companies in terms of premium payments, scheme performance, additional facilities and cost structure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ULIPs vs Traditional Plans vs Mutual Funds</h2>
<p>These three investment options can often be seen locking horns with each other. But who's the best among them - ULIPs, Traditional Plans or Mutual Funds? The answer primarily depends on three factors:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Risk appetite</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment goals</strong></li>
<li><strong>Financial health</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When putting the aforementioned financial products to comparison, one should keep in mind, insurance is imperative as it is about protecting his/her loved ones from the unexpected circumstances; on the other hand, investment is a choice, made with the sole intention of multiplying his/her wealth.</p>

<h2>Types of ULIP Charges</h2>
</div>
<p>ULIPs do have certain charges associated with them, which can be sub-divided into multiple categories. Following are the ones that must be known by an investor:</p>
<h3><strong>Premium Allocation Charges</strong></h3>
<p>The charges, namely premium allocation charges are imposed - beforehand on the premium paid by the investor. These are the initial expenses incurred by a company in issuing the policy, like medical expenses and underwriting cost. New age ULIP plans, also referred to as 4G ULIPs are online-only model and come with zero premium allocation charges.</p>
<h3><strong>Administration Charges</strong></h3>
<p>These charges are deducted regularly for the recovery of expenses borne by the insurance company for maintaining a life insurance policy. 4G ULIP comes with zero administration charges.</p>
<h3><strong>Surrender Charges</strong></h3>
<p>These charges refer to the deduction for full or partial encashment of premature units subject to the policy documents. These charges are levied as a percentage of the fund value or as a percentage of the premium.</p>
<h3><strong>Mortality Charges</strong></h3>
<p>The expenses, namely mortality charges are borne by the insurer to provide a life cover to insured, which vary with the age and sum assured of the policy. These charges are deducted on a monthly basis.</p>
<h3><strong>Fund Management Charges</strong></h3>
<p>The aggregated sum through <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com//life-insurance/ulip-plans/articles/top-5-ulip-funds-to-invest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ULIP funds</a> is invested in equity instruments and debt. The insurer bears these charges for fund management, which vary with both fund and plan. The amount is subject to deduction calculating the net asset value or NAV.</p>
<h3><strong>Fund Switching Charges</strong></h3>
<p>ULIP plans enable the investors to invest their hard-earned money in different fund options that further have multiple debts equity exposure as well as provide them with the option to switch between different funds for which their insurance company will charge the switching fee. Most of the policies provide few free switches every year.</p>
<h3><strong>Discontinuance Charges</strong></h3>
<p>On premature discontinuation of a plan within lock-in period, the insurer deducts a small fee. Since these charges are pre-set by IRDA, these are the same for almost all policies.</p>
<p>In ULIP, premiums the investors pay are invested in debt and equity instruments, chosen by them, after deducting allocation and other charges. The value of each fund is computed by dividing total value of the fund’s investment by the total number of units.</p>
<h3><strong>Partial Withdrawal Charges</strong></h3>
<p>The policyholder can carry out lump sum withdrawals from the fund after the policy lapses and subject to the pre-determined conditions. Nevertheless, the partial withdrawals attract charges, as specified in the respective policy document.</p>
<p>ULIP NAV, in everyday terminology, refers to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of each unit of the ULIP fund on a particular day. The insurance companies generally display this NAV of each fund on their websites under the relevant section.</p>
<h2>What is ULIP NAV?</h2>
<p>Though ULIP NAV is now more understood on a per unit basis, in the strict financial sense, it refers to the net value of the assets of the firm. In other words, this NAV equals the assets minus liabilities. The assets taken to calculate the NAV of these plans include the market value of investments held by the insurance company’s fund, the value of the fund’s current assets and any accrued income. The liabilities taken to calculate the NAV include fund management charges, current liabilities, provisions and service tax.</p>
<p>To arrive at the NAV of a single unit, the ULIP NAV of the whole fund is divided by the number of units in the fund existing on the valuation date. The resulting figure is the NAV per unit of the plan, which is what common terminology refers to when speaking of ULIP NAV.</p>
<p>As per a directive of IRDA in 2013, the valuation of equity shares is now calculated on the closing price of the company’s shares on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which is also the primary exchange. In case a security is not listed or traded on the NSE, the closing price of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) or the secondary exchange has to be used for the purpose of computation of ULIP NAV.</p>
<p>Like mutual funds, ULIP policyholders are also allotted units. Each unit has a net asset value (NAV) that is determined and declared every day. It is the value on which net rate of returns on ULIPs are determined. The NAV varies from one ULIP to another as it is based on prevailing market conditions and the performance of the fund.</p>
<h2>Who should invest in ULIP?</h2>
<p>The following are the ULIPs for different classes of investors:</p>
<h3><strong>People with Varying Risk Appetites</strong></h3>
<p>Most insurance companies offering unit linked plans provide a range of debt, equity and a mixture of debt and equity funds to choose from to cater to all kinds of consumers. Equity funds offer higher returns and are appropriate for aggressive investors willing to take high risks. On the other hand, debt funds are less risky and consequently offer lower returns. Therefore, a ULIP plan serves all types of investors – from the risk-averse investor to an investor having a strong appetite for risk. Keeping a track of the historical NAV of these plans will help the person looking for the best ULIP plan to understand which one he or she should invest in. </p>
<p>People looking for an avenue for investment along with insurance will find ULIPs a good choice as one stands to gain from superior market returns in addition to having an insurance cover.</p>
<h3><strong>People with Medium to Long Term Investment Horizon</strong></h3>
<p>Unit Linked Insurance Plans are suitable for people who wish to invest in long-term investments. To get the best returns from ULIPs, one should invest in medium to lifelong investment horizons. In any case, they come with a compulsory lock-in period of 5 years. If one wants to create a corpus for his or her child’s higher education requirements or the child’s marriage expenditure, a unit linked insurance plan is a good choice due to its long-term outlook. Individuals can track the simple details such as the NAV of the unit linked plan, the total value of the fund, the equity-debt allocation to find the best ULIP plan for them.</p>
<h3><strong>Hands-On Investors</strong></h3>
<p>ULIP plans are most suited for individuals who like to track their investments closely. Since each insurance company provides the NAV for each of its unit linked insurance plans on its site, people can easily determine which the best ULIP plan for their needs is. Moreover, with the flexibility of switching between debt, equity and balanced funds with varying risk-return profiles, hands-on informed investors will find ULIPs the best investment plan as they can keep close tabs on their investment and make changes based on how the market is performing. The fact that these ULIP plans offer insurance cover also is an added bonus.</p>
<h3><strong>Investors across Different Life Stages</strong></h3>
<p>ULIP plans are ideal for all kinds of investors at different stages in life as there are ULIP plans available depending on individual requirements and situations.</p>
<p>The need for protection is low for single people who have just started their careers. Their need for wealth creation and accumulation however is high; therefore, they can meet such needs by choosing a unit linked insurance plan with low death benefit and allocating in equity-focused investment funds. Keeping track of the NAV of these plans will further help them maximise returns by choosing the best ULIP plans for themselves.</p>
<p>Someone who is married but has no children has medium protection needs but has a high need for wealth creation. Such individuals can opt for a unit linked plan with higher death benefit and choose a growth or balanced investment fund for wealth creation.</p>
<p>For married individuals who are also parents, the need for protection is high, as is the need for asset creation to save for children. They can achieve this by choosing a ULIP plan with increased death benefit and choose riders for enhanced protection in addition to going for balanced funds for asset creation. Checking the NAV of these plans on a regular basis will help them optimise their fund allocation through the years.</p>
<p>People who are well settled in their jobs and have school going children have high protection as well as wealth creation needs. Their need for liquidity is also high to meet their child’s requirements. It is most advisable to go for a unit linked plan, which allows partial withdrawals to meet such liquidity requirements.</p>
<p>The need for protection is in the medium range for middle-aged individuals whose children are ready to pursue higher education or plan to set up a business or plan to get married. They require lump sum money to fulfil such responsibilities and this can be achieved by a ULIP plan allowing partial withdrawals.</p>
<p>People who are nearing retirement, whose children are independent, have low protection needs. They require safe accumulation of funds for post-retirement needs. Such individuals can opt for debt-oriented funds and lower the death benefit of their ULIP plan. These people should opt for the best ULIP plan for themselves that will give them regular returns without them having to worry about the NAV.</p>
<h2>Myths about Investing in a ULIP Plan – Busted</h2>
<p>A ULIP plan is a great product combining the benefits of insurance and investment in one single financial instrument. But, there exist many myths associated with unit linked plans because of misinformation and lack of clarity in the minds of consumers. Common myths of a ULIP plan are:</p>
<h3><strong>Myth 1: ULIPs are costly due to multiple inherent charges</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> People with the question ‘What is ULIP?’ have been led to believe that a ULIP plan is an expensive investment product due to charges like those towards premium allocation, fund management among other. The reality is that unit linked plans have changed significantly. People may not be aware but the IRDA of India (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) in 2010 has brought down the annual charges to 3% for the first 10 years of the holding period and 2.25% for more than 10 years of holding. This reduction excludes mortality and morbidity charges. The fund management charges (FMC) have also been capped at 1.35%. Capping of charges has been done to provide a reasonable value proposition to the customers. The charges were fixed at this rate because competing products such as mutual funds were charging an average cost similar to this. This has considerably brought down the cost of owing ULIPs and has made them affordable.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth 2: ULIPs are risky financial instruments</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Another myth is that a ULIP plan is riskier investment product as it only invests in the equity market. This is absolutely not true. For anyone wanting to know what is ULIP offering, a ULIP plan gives the option of investing in debt, equity or a mixture of debt and equity as per the wishes of the policyholder. Depending on the type of risk one can take, different funds can be selected with different objectives. Aggressive funds which primarily invest in equity are apt for high risk-takers while conservative funds, which are debt-oriented, are more suited for risk-averse people. There is also the option of a balanced fund, which is a mix of equity and debt. A ULIP plan also gives the option of switching between funds as per change in personal conditions, change in risk appetite, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth 3: ULIPs do not allow investment of surplus funds</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> <strong>ULIPs</strong> do allow investment of surplus funds. Surplus funds can be added as per availability to a unit linked insurance plan with a lower premium. Top-up premiums can be paid any time during the tenure of the existing unit linked policy and they enjoy the same tax benefits as regular premiums.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth 4: ULIPs allow continuation</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> People with the query ‘What is ULIP?’ have been confused and often misled into believing that ULIPs cannot be discontinued at all. Once can discontinue a unit linked plan after minimum 5 years of lock-in period without payment of any surrender charges.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth 5: Market volatility reduces life cover</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> There is also this confusion in the minds of consumers that the life cover under a ULIP decreases with market volatility. However, this is not true. The life cover remains unaffected with the rise and fall of stock markets. In case the insured dies during the policy term, ULIPs pay either the complete life cover or the fund value whichever is higher.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth 6: Health and accident cover is not provided in ULIPs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> This again is completely untrue. A ULIP plan offers policyholders the twin benefits of insurance and investment. In addition, a ULIP plan has many optional rider options like other insurance products. Common riders are Accidental Death Benefit, Family Income Benefit, Hospital Cash Benefit, Waiver of Premium, etc. Additional cash requirements in case of emergencies can be taken care of through partial withdrawals. There may be some restrictions on clubbing two optional riders together but investors can always get the best ULIP plan with a suitable NAV for themselves.</p>
<h3><strong>Myth 7: ULIPs offer low returns</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> This again is a false notion prevalent among many people. The fact is that if money is invested judiciously in different funds with varying degree of exposure to equity and debt markets, investors stand a chance to lock in good returns upon maturity. The choice for funds, timely switching, redirection of funds or premiums, all ensure that one’s fund growth is healthy. Another thing to understand is that bare long term investment vehicles. With disciplined investing, they give attractive returns over the long term in addition to a life cover. All policyholders have to do is to keep a track of the NAV to get a policy that suits their needs. They can also opt for a different fund allocation that gives better returns after checking the NAV of these plans.</p>

                    <p>Here is the difference between the two investment options:<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>SIP</strong></p>
<p><br />SIP stands for a systematic investment plan that enables an investor to invest a stipulated amount of money in his/her preferred mutual funds at a pre-stipulated interval of time. The investment periodicity can vary from monthly to quarterly or annual basis. In simple words, a systematic investment plan is a planned approach that helps an investor to accrue a large corpus over a period of time.</p>
<p><strong><br />ULIP</strong></p>
<p><br />It is a unique insurance plan, as it comes with double benefits. It is a perfect blend of investment and insurance in a single plan. A ULIP offers the investor to enjoy insurance benefits along with the opportunity to invest in a wide range of investment options of his choice such as bonds and stocks. By this means, the investor enjoys market-linked returns and his/ her insurance needs are also taken care of at the same time.</p>                </div>

                    <p>A Unit-Linked Insurance Plan is a product offered by various insurance providers. Contrary to pure insurance plans, ULIPs offer best of both worlds by offering investment and insurance benefit under a single umbrella.<br /><br /></p>
<p>A share of the premium is paid for meeting mortality charges that provide life cover. The remaining share is invested in policyholder's preferred funds. Invested funds earn market linked returns.</p>
<p><br />A ULIP policyholder can get top-notch facilities like top-up, switching between different funds as long as the policy is active, reduction or increment in the protection level, the option of surrendering, add-on riders to upgrade insurance coverage, better returns, and applicable tax benefits.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Types of ULIP</strong></p>
<p><br />Based on the death benefit, ULIPs can be categorized into 2 types, i.e. Type I and Type II.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Under Type I ULIP, the plan comes with the higher of sum assured and fund value. Under Type-II ULIP, the plan offers assured sum and fund value as the death benefit, in case the insured passes away.</p>
<p><br />ULIPs vary on the basis of investor&rsquo;s investment objective, his/her risk appetite, his/her investment horizon etc. Some ULIPs ensure investment safety by investing a large share of the invested money in debt component while other ULIPs invest specifically in equity.</p>

                    <p>Internet has completely revolutionized the way in which insurance is sold and bought. In online sector, agent is not involved and therefore, insurance company saves commission and other operating costs which are involved in offline product. Due to this saving, premiums are cheaper and you need to pay less to buy an insurance product online.&nbsp; In case of endowment and term plans, discount rates on premium can vary anywhere between 2-5%.&nbsp; Also, charges are low in online field. When you decide to buy ULIPS online, you make a huge saving as no charges are incurred for premium allocation, policy administration and discontinuance, except fund management charges.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Moreover, claim settlement ratio in online insurance sector is also overwhelming. The past years reports have showed that claim ratio has reached over 90% in the online insurance sector.</p>                </div>

                    <p>Every insurance policy offers 15 days free-look period to the policyholder after the insured receives policy documents. During this period, if he/she is not satisfied with the policy, then the policy can be returned back to the respective company, who is bound to refund premium amount that has been paid, subject to the deductions like stamp duty that has been paid on the policy, premium for the number of days coverage has been given. In case of ULIP, net asset value (NAV) as on the date of returning the policy after deducting all expenses is paid to the policyholder.<br /><br /></p>
<p>If you discontinue after free-look period, these deductions would be high. So make sure you take prompt decision regarding insurance policy within free-look period to avoid unnecessary deduction.</p>                </div>

                    <p>No matter how exciting it might seem to invest in ULIPs, it is important to understand that by opting for this investment plan, you run the risk of exposing your money to the uncertainties of the market. ULIPs offer both insurance coverage and investment option. But you should also keep this in mind that the vagaries of the market can affect even the best performing investment plan. So, understand your risk appetite and then make a choice accordingly.<br /><br /></p>
<p>The best part of having an investment plan is that you can switch from one fund to another, which you find less risky. It means, it has a very open structure.&nbsp; The other innovative aspect of the ULIPs is the 'top up facility', which allows you to make an additional investment apart from the annual premium of the policy. This feature is useful when you have surplus funds and you want to invest in the market.</p>
<p><br />Unit-linked insurance plan is directly proportionate to risk. It means, higher risk more returns and vice versa.</p>
<p><br />If you invest for a longer duration then you will yield high returns. The past performance of the fund gives you a fair idea about the functioning of a plan.</p>
<p><br />ULIPs also come with the facility that allows you to skip premiums if you have regularly paid premiums for the first three years. Also, ULIPs disclose their portfolios. This will help you in getting an idea of how your money is being invested in the market. Since ULIPs are NAV based, therefore, it is feasible to withdraw some portion of investment before the maturity, provided lock-in period is over. You can make this investment option work in your favour by using it judiciously.</p>                </div>

So, the best way to deal with this dilemma is to make a proper comparison between both investment instruments on the basis of different parameters.</p>

<p><em><u>Which one to invest in?</u></em></p>
<p>Unit-linked Insurance Plan may not be an ideal choice if you are a short term investor because commission rates may gradually decrease with the time. Also, exiting the policy in a short term may yield very low returns as a large chunk of your investment would go in meeting exit charges. If you are a short term investor who is looking at wealth creation, mutual fund would be a preferred option.</p>                </div>

                <div class="ansData">
                    <p>In the recent years, IRDAI had capped charges (excluding mortality) at 3% for ULIP policies with tenure of up to 10 years and 2.25% for those policies with term of over 10 years. As a result, commission rate and surcharge values have come down. Due to this, insurance companies have launched ULIPs at a low cost.<br /><br /></p>
<p>These investment-cum-insurance plans have become a low cost investment option. Indeed, it is a right time to break the historical aversion to ULIPs and start investing in them. Unlike mutual funds, maturity proceedings in unit-linked insurance plans are tax free under the Section 10(10d).</p>                </div>

                    <p>Below are the terms which are usually associated with ULIPs-&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Unit</strong> &ndash; A single part of a Unit Linked Fund is called as a Unit. Now what is this Unit Linked Fund? The insurance provider makes a pool of funds out of the premiums of all the policyholders (left after deduction of charges and deduction of the portion to be invested for life cover). This pool is meant to be invested in assets such as debt and equity instrument and is called as Unit Linked Fund.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Funds</strong> &ndash; Funds are various financial instruments in which an investment is made. Debt, equity, cash and hybrids are the common type of funds in ULIPs. In the case of ULIPs, switching between funds is an investor&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p><strong><br />NAV</strong> &ndash; Net Asset Value. It&rsquo;s the value of each unit of the fund. NAV is very dynamic and changes on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong><br />Top Up</strong> &ndash; The additional premium that can be paid on the plan over and above the regular premium is the Top Up. But why would anyone want to pay an additional premium? Well, because of 2 reasons &ndash;</p>
<p><br />Getting more units without having to pay the high allocation charges (40% for the regular premium, 1-2% for the top-up)</p>
<p><strong><br />Additional life cover</strong></p>
<p><br />Top-up can&rsquo;t be made in the first year and the last five years of the policy term. Top Up is a personal choice and the investor is not liable to pay it on a regular basis.</p>                </div>

                    <p>ULIPs can be broadly classified under two heads-<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Type I ULIP -</strong> In case the insured dies, the nominees are paid either the sum assured or the fund value, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Type II ULIP -</strong> In case the insured dies, the nominees are paid a total of sum assured and the fund value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, Type II ULIP is preferred over Type I ULIP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unit-linked Insurance Plan can also be classified on the basis of the purpose it serves &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wealth ULIPs</strong> - The focus is on multiplying wealth. In such plans, investment is made keeping in mind a longer frame of time to maximize returns from the investments.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Child ULIPs </strong>- Insurance cum investment plans that serve 2 purposes, to financially secure your child&rsquo;s future and to finance the turning points in his life such as higher education and marriage.</p>
<p><strong><br />Pension ULIPs</strong> - The objective is to make sure that when you retire and run out of regular earnings, you should have something to thrive on. This ULIP pays the pensioner regular annuities after he retires.</p>                </div>
