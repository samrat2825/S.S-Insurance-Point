</div>
<p class="paragraphBu" style="text-align: justify;">Car Insurance is a contract between the insurance company and insured that safeguards the policyholder against financial loss in case of theft or accident. A car insurance policy also offers coverage for damage or loss caused to your car. It is mandate to buy car insurance in India irrespective of the vehicle type, i.e. personal or commercial vehicle.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px; float: right;" src="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/Motor/what-is-car-insurance-policy.jpg" alt="What is car insurance" width="380" height="480" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per law, it is mandatory for vehicle owners to buy car insurance for their vehicles plying on Indian roads. However, the Parliament passed the amendments to the Motor Vehicle Act, which was effective from September 1, 2019. This has not been a good sign for the car owners as driving errors are now making a big dent in their monthly budget and some of these owners may even cost them the same or more than their monthly fuel bills.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">The premium amount of your car insurance is decided on the basis of Insured Declared Value or IDV of the vehicle. If you increase the IDV, the premium rises and if you lower it, the premium reduces. It is important for any policyholder to compare various car insurance options before going for a car insurance renewal or buying a new policy.</p>

<h2 class="ctacustomheading" style="width: auto; display: inline-block;"><strong>Key Benefits of Car Insurance</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>The car insurance plan offers the following benefits:</strong></p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Coverage against loss or damage to the insured vehicle.</li>
<li>Coverage against loss or damage to your vehicle caused by accident, theft, fire, explosion, self-ignition, lightning, riots, strikes or act of terrorism, natural calamities.</li>
<li>Coverage against financial liability caused by the injury/death of a third party or damage to the property.</li>
<li>Personal accidental insurance cover.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Types of Car Insurance in India</strong></h2>
<p>There are primarily 2 types of Car Insurance that are available in India -</p>
<div class="icon-div">
<h3 class="ctacustomheading" style="width: auto; display: inline-block;"><strong>Third Party Liability Car Insurance </strong></h3>
</div>

<p>Third Party Liability Car Insurance safeguards you from any legal liability due to your own car’s involvement in an accident. Your insurance provider will compensate you for death, disability, injury, or property damage to any third-party. Therefore, you are protected from the financial liability towards the third-party.</p>
<p>Third-party Liability Car Insurance is a mandate in India under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.</p>
<h3><strong>Comprehensive Car Insurance</strong></h3>
<p>A comprehensive car insurance policy provides coverage for third party liability as well as damages caused to your own car. In comparison with third party liability car insurance, a comprehensive car insurance policy offers extensive coverage, more benefits and covers the damages caused to the insured car in case of an accident, collision, theft, etc.</p>
<p>A comprehensive policy can be further extended by opting for add-ons like accessories cover, engine protector, zero depreciation cover, medical expenses, etc. This type of coverage is the most popular as it offers end-to-end coverage and thus less stress for the policyholder.</p>

<h2 class="ctacustomheading" style="width: auto; display: inline-block;"><strong>Why is it Necessary to Compare Car Insurance Policies?</strong></h2>
<p>Car insurance comparison is recommended as it can help you save a substantial amount of money and offer you better coverage options. With the help of comparison, you can get best car insurance quotes and save up to 80% on premiums including additional riders. Make an informed decision while buying car insurance online.</p>
<p>Before digging into comparing different car insurance plans, ascertain the kind of coverage you need. A liability policy is inexpensive than the comprehensive car insurance policy but only if you are ready to compromise on some benefits because the facilities offered by the later is the best undoubtedly.</p>
<h2>Basis of Car Insurance Comparison</h2>
<p>You can compare car insurance plans on the basis of following factors:</p>
<h3><strong>Comparing Car Insurance Companies</strong></h3>
<p>Car insurance comparison is successful only when you compare different plans from reliable insurance companies. Some insurers might offer total coverage at the lowest price. It might sound good, but you should always check if the insurer is credible or not.  You can check customer reviews and the insurer’s claim settlement ratio online.</p>
<h3><strong>Compared to the coverage Option</strong></h3>
<p>The coverage offered in liability policy differs from the comprehensive policy. While liability plan only covers third-party liability, the comprehensive one covers you for the damages to the vehicle and the owner which is called as Personal Accident Cover.</p>
<p>The limit varies from plans to plan. Moreover, additional add-on benefits are also offered by some car insurance plans. So, it is necessary to check and compare this trait to decide the personal accidental cover along with the additional coverage, if any under the same car insurance plan.</p>
<h3><strong>Compare the Insured Declare Value</strong></h3>
<p>The varied rate of IDV's reflects different rates of premiums. Insured Declared Value, abbreviated as IDV, is the current value of the car after being adjusted for appropriate reduction. The rate of depreciation depends on the age of your car. Older the car, higher would be the depreciation and lowered would be your IDV. And it affects the Sum Assured. Hence, compare the IDV quotes offered by different car insurance plans is a must.</p>
<h3><strong>Compare Insurer's Claim Settlement Practice</strong></h3>
<p>Claim settlement is the most crucial part of an insurance policy. Every buyer expects a hassle-free claim process and easiness of any car insurance policy which he is planning to invest in. Each insurance company has its own procedure. Hereby, it is essential to compare the claim settlement process of each car insurance plan which is in your preference list to find out which type of rules best suits you and would enable a faster claim settlement.</p>
<h3><strong>Comparing Premiums and Deductibles</strong></h3>
<p>Car insurance comparison should be done online on the basis of the deductibles and the premium. Car insurance premium also varies on the basis of the deductibles. Deductible refers to the amount that the insured has to pay at the time of claim settlement.</p>
<p>For instance, if the claim amount is Rs. 25000 for accidental repairs and our voluntary deductible are Rs. 5000, and then the insurer will pay off Rs. 20000 at the time of claim. Deductibles certainly reduce the premium amount. However, choose deductibles only when you can pay the cost. Also, check<strong>-</strong>out discounts at the time of purchasing car insurance policy such as No Claim Bonus and any rewards.</p>

<h2><strong>Add-On Covers in Car Insurance</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Add-on covers are the additional covers or protection that you include in your car insurance plan to keep your car safe from any damages or total loss. The add-on covers need to be purchased on payment of extra premium amount. Following some add-on covers are No Claim Bonus Protection cover, Zero Depreciation cover, Engine Protection cover, Key protection cover, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>No Claim Bonus Protection Cover</strong></h3>
<p>For every claim free year, the insured is rewarded with a discount on the renewal premium. This discount is called - No Claim Bonus (NCB). It is cumulative and increases every year. It usually ranges from 10% to 50% and can save a substantial amount of money on the premium payable for your auto insurance.</p>
<p>Let's take an example if a policyholder doesn't make a claim during the tenure of his auto insurance policy, he becomes eligible for No Claim Bonus, on the basis of which, a certain rebate is offered on the payable premium. With No-claim-bonus protection cover you can retain your NCB even after registering a claim during the policy term. The terms and conditions vary from one insurer to another.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Save Premium on Car Insurance Policy?</strong></h2>
<p>A smart customer is in a constant hunt for discounts which will reduce the burden on his pocket. If you are one among them then here are a few tips that will help you get a discount and save money on the premium value of your car insurance.</p>
<h3><strong>Voluntary Access</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Voluntary deductible is the minimum amount that you declare to bear at the time of claim. The higher deductible you opt for, the lower will be your premium. Simply put it means that the financial burden on the insurance provider is less and you will also chip in when an accident or car damage happens.</p>
<h3><strong>Anti-theft Discount</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">In case your car is fitted with an ARAI approved anti-theft device, your insurer will offer an additional discount (2.5% on the OD Premium). This discount is provided for the simple reason that an anti-theft device will make your car less liable to theft.</p>
<h3><strong>Privilege Membership</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Members of the Automobile Association and some Professionals (Defence Personnel, Doctors and Govt. Employees) are entitled to get additional discount on their premium. So, never miss out to mention the same while searching for a quote. While getting quotes for your vehicle at Policy Bazaar, you might see for yourself how changing even minor details make a huge difference to the final calculated premium.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">For example, take the case of Dr. Gupta. He's a doctor by profession and needs car insurance for his brand new Renault Duster. His car is fitted with an ARAI approved anti-theft kit. While getting a car insurance quote, he neither mentions his profession nor the fact that his car is fitted with an anti-theft kit. Thus he ends up paying a higher premium. On the contrary, if he did mention about these then, needless to say, his premium could have been lower by 25%.</p>
