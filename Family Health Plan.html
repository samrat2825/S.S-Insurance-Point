<h2><strong>Types of Family Health Plan</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">A family health plan offers coverage to all family members subject to the policy terms. Based on the types of health coverage offered, a health insurance plan can be broadly classified into two categories mentioned below:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Medical Insurance: </strong>A medical insurance policy typically reimburses the hospitalization cost subject to healthcare treatment. The insurance company bears the expense in the form of cashless treatment or reimbursement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="paragraphBu"><strong>Critical Illness Insurance: </strong>This type of policy covers a policyholder against chronic diseases like heart attack, stroke, kidney failure etc. Subject to policy coverage, the insurance company pays the entire sum assured to the policyholder in the form of a lump-sum. However, critical illness insurance cannot be purchased as a single policy for the entire family.</p>

<h2><strong>Understanding Family Health Plan</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">Here are a few important points that you must consider before buying a health insurance plan for your family. Go through below points to resolve any confusion you might have regarding a family health plan.</p>
<h3><strong>Basic Coverage under a Family Health Plan</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">While making a comparison of different family health insurance plans, it is important to make a list of basic health coverage offered under the policy. Almost all health plans offer daycare expenses, in-hospitalization expenses, ambulance charges, etc. If you are planning for a child, you should go for the family health plan that covers insurance for new born baby or simply add the baby as beneficiary to your existing family floater health plan. Also the policy comparison should be done keeping in mind your coverage for pre existing diseases, lifestyle and exclusions during the first 30 days of the policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Ask for the Maximum Renewal Age</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Many health insurance companies offer policy renewal till 60-65 years. Nowadays, some health insurance companies also offer lifelong renewal facility. Make sure to choose the family floater health plan that would protect you when you need it most.</p>
<h3><strong>Flexibility to Increase the Sum Assured of a Family Floater Health Plan</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">The living costs never remain same, so is the cost of medical treatment. Most insurers offer the facility to upgrade the sum insured in the coming years. Sometimes, when you renew timely and have No Claim Bonus the insurance provider company will reward you by increasing the amount of sun insured.</p>
<h3><strong>Get Hassle-free Claim Settlement</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Although all health insurance companies follow the same claim process as directed by the insurance regulator, there might be some differences in aspects of each company's functionality. Before buying any health insurance plan for your family, make a point to explicitly understand the company's claim settlement process. Many companies these days offer cashless hospitalization so no hassle about collecting documents and filling them.</p>
<h3><strong>Avail Seamless Cashless Hospitalization</strong></h3>
<p class="paragraphBu">Nowadays, almost every health insurance company is offering cashless hospitalization in their network hospitals. This makes the hospitalization process seamless and hassle-free. However, it is imperative to cross check the same to ensure that names of good hospitals are included in the list.</p>

<h2><strong>Advantages of a Family Health Plan</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">This family health plan is a comprehensive one wherein under one plan you can cover the complete family. This plan is suited for huge families where members vary hugely in age like a child and a grandparent. You can put all the members, irrespective f their age, under one plan umbrella.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Hassle-free :</strong> A family health plan in India is the best way to safeguard the health of your loved ones. Since it is a single policy that covers the entire family, it relieves you from the task of maintaining and keeping track of different health policies. By choosing family floater health plan, you can get rid of the need of paying premium separately for every family member. In this way, you can get all your family members eligible to get medical attention without compromising on the treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Avail Discounts on Family Health Plan : </strong>Under the family floater, you can avail discounts and incentives that policies usually offer. Based on certain parameters it allows a person to enjoy discounts accordingly. Family health plan is an easy way to plan for a secure future.</li>
<li><strong>Easy To Add New family Members : </strong>In this mediclaim plan, it is easy to add a new family member whenever there is any such need. With an individual cover, a fresh policy needs to be taken each time when there is an addition of a new member to the family. If you add your parents to an existing family health plan, make sure to opt for a higher sum assured. Also, in case of the unfortunate demise of the senior most member of the family, other family members can continue with the floater without losing any benefit. This is one of the biggest benefits that a family floater health plan provides.</li>
<li><strong>Includes Parents Insurance and In-Laws too : </strong>Many of the insurers provide an option to include parents-in-law with little extra cost, making it the best health insurance for parents of both sides of a family.</li>

<div class="icon-div"><span class="sprite_content exclusion-family-plan" title="Common Exclusions of Family Health Plans 1">icon</span>
<h2><strong>Common Exclusions of a Family floater Health Plan</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">Before buying a family floater health insurance plan, you must thoroughly read the policy documents in order to understand the policy exclusions in detail. Also, make sure to understand different clauses mentioned in the insurance policy like pre-existing diseases, cashless hospitalization, and waiting period, as these terms more or less decide whether you're going to get a claim or not subject to hospitalization.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">A family health plan covers all members of your family, including you and your spouse along with up to 2 children (can be 4 as well subject to the policy terms). You can choose to include your parents in your existing family health plan subject to an additional premium payment. However, as soon as the oldest person in your family reaches the maximum age to avail the coverage, the policy expires automatically. Also, any pre-existing medical condition is not covered up to a certain period.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">Furthermore, a family floater health insurance plan covers dependent children up to a certain age (typically up to 18 years) only. Once a child crosses that age, the policy no longer covers him or her.</p>
<div class="icon-div"><span class="sprite_content family-plan-betterden" title="Family Health Plan">icon</span>
<h2><strong> Is a Family Health Plan better than an Individual Health Plan?</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">It's quite difficult to say which type of health insurance plan is better out of a family health plan and an individual health plan unless we compare the coverage provided by both the plans in different practical scenarios.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">A family health plan covers the entire family for a single sum assured and a single premium needs to be paid to the insurance company. In other words, there is only one policy for the entire family, and the premium payment is also a single in a year. On the flip side, an individual health plan covers only one person and therefore, there has to be a separate health plan for each family member. Since there are multiple policies, the premium payable for each policy will also be different.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">If we compare the premiums payable for both these types of a health insurance plan, the combined premium payable for multiple individual health plans is significantly higher than that for a family health plan.</p>
<div class="icon-div"><span class="sprite_content family-plan-eligibility" title="Family Health Plan Eligibility">icon</span>
<h2><strong>Family Health Plan Eligibility Criteria</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">A family health plan is more like a <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/health-insurance/group-health-insurance/">group health insurance plan</a>. It allows you to include several members of your family in a single plan for a single sum assured at a single annual premium. If yours is a family of 4 or 6, you can purchase a family health plan and you need not meet specific eligibility criteria.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">There are certain key points that you must keep in mind when you're going to buy a family health plan. These points are given below:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>It allows you to include new members in the policy at the cost of an additional premium.</li>
<li>The policy expires as soon as the eldest member of the family reaches the maximum covered age of a person.</li>
<li>Choose to increase the sum assured if you include new family members in the policy to ensure sufficient coverage for an individual family member.</li>
<li>The policy no longer covers a dependent child as soon as he/she cross the age limit specified in the policy document.</li>
<li>Don't include your senior citizen parents in your existing family health plan, as it will significantly increase the premium.</li>
</ul>
<p class="paragraphBu">In a nutshell, almost any family can choose to buy a family health plan within its budget. Also, the premium is lesser than that of the combined premium payable for an individual health plan.</p>
<div class="icon-div"><span class="sprite_content buynew-family-plan" title="Buy a New Family Health Plan">icon</span>
<h2><strong>How to Buy a New Family Health Plan?</strong></h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraphBu">If you currently have a health insurance plan and you want to include your family members in it, ask your insurer about the same. However, if you're new to insurance and want to buy a family health plan to cover your immediate family, you have various insurers to choose from. For your own convenience, you can go online and compare multiple family health plans to choose the best one within your budget.</p>
<p class="paragraphBu">It is advisable not to look for the policy with the least premium, as you cannot compromise on the coverage. There is no point in having a health plan with insufficient coverage just because you don't want to pay less, as you might still have to pay for your healthcare expenses from your own pocket. Therefore, make your decision wisely.</p>

<li>Yes, we strongly recommend that you buy a standalone health policy, even if you are covered in a corporate health policy. Your employer will cover your medical costs as long as you are working in that organization. When you change a job, retire or start something on your own, the corporate insurance will be rendered useless. You and your family will be stranded if a medical emergency arises and you have no other health policy to fall back on.</li>
<li>Also, if a company makes sudden changes to its conditions or abruptly stops insurance coverage, you may need to bear all medical costs. At this point of time, a separate health insurance policy will come to your rescue. Moreover, health insurance plan can supplement your current medical cover incase medical costs are higher than your corporate health cover. Also health insurance is considered as a good tax saving instrument because by buying health plan, you become eligible to get tax benefits under Section 80D.</li>

                    <p>Family floater plans provide coverage to the entire family under a single plan. Here the fixed cover is shared by all members of a family. A family floater policy is one of the best options when it comes to protecting the health of your family members. Since it is a policy which covers the entire family, it relieves you from the task of buying separate health policies for each family member and thus, it offers affordability also. Although, family floater plans usually cover the individual, spouse and kids but there are some insurers which are offering a provision to cover dependent parents and in-laws also under family floater.</p>                </div>

                <div class="ansData">
                    <p>Yes, you can take multiple health policies from the same company or from different insurance companies but it is important to inform about the existing policies to the other insurer while buying a policy or at the time of making a claim. If you fail to disclose it, then it means you are violating one of the important terms and conditions of the health insurance company and in case of investigation this could be counted as misrepresentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s understand the claim procedure by taking into account different scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: When total claim amount is less than the sum assured under a single policy</strong></p>
<p>In case of indemnity policies like mediclaim or hospital reimbursement type insurance, if the insured opts for multiple policies in the same tenure and the claim amount is less than the sum assured, then insured has all rights to choose from which insurer he wants to make a claim. For instance, Mr. Kumar has Rs 4 lakh insurance policy from Insurer X and Rs 2 lakh policy from Insurer Y. The claim amount is Rs 2 lakh. In this case, the insured can choose any insurance company who will be bound to settle the claim as per terms and conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Scenario 2: When claim amount is more than the sum assured under a single policy</strong></p>
<p>In this case, insured has all rights to choose the insurer who will settle claims. However, if at the time of a claim settlement, insured doesn&rsquo;t disclose about other policies, then the insurer&rsquo;s liability is restricted up to the sum assured and the policyholder will have to bear remaining expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Claim under defined benefit policies</strong></p>
<p>If the insured has got defined benefits like critical illness where claim doesn&rsquo;t have any relation with the treatment cost and the payable amount is fixed, then insured will be entitled to get benefits from all policies.</p>
<p>Here the real mantra is to make a claim under the old policies wherein insurance has past the waiting period for a lot of ailments.</p>                </div>
