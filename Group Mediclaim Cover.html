                <p>Health Is Wealth is a very famous saying, and everyone tries different methods to maintain their wellbeing. However, life never follows a fixed pattern and thus, bodily injury or sudden illness can occur to anybody and may leave one both financially and physically stressed. Therefore, it is always good to have a medical insurance policy for such situations.</p>
<p>There are various different types of health insurance policies available in the market and group health insurance is one. A group health insurance plan is used to provide risk coverage to the people who belong to a specific group. Generally, this policy is given by employers to employees.</p>

There are some group health insurance plans that cover the families of the insured people as well. So, it entirely depends upon the organization what kind of group health insurance plan it selects.</p>
<p>When the group health insurance is provided by the employer, then both employee and employer are supposed to be the beneficiary. This is because; the plan addresses both the parties of a group.</p>

<li><strong>Tax Benefits: </strong>As mentioned above both employer and employees are the beneficiaries in a health insurance plan for the group, thus the employer also gets tax benefits for providing such policies to its employees.</li>

<li><strong>An Extensive Range of Coverage with No Limited on Diseases: </strong>Apart from covering pre-existing diseases, a group health insurance plan for employees provides a wider coverage with no limit on diseases.</li>
<li><strong>Larger Maternity Coverage: </strong>A wider maternity cover is one of the best advantages given to young employees. Most of these plans provide coverage for both C-section and normal deliveries. Some plans as well cover the newborn babies without a standard 90 days of maternity cover.</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Group Health Insurance (or Group Mediclaim) provides healthcare coverage to a group of people belonging to a common community (typically as employees of a company). Group Health Insurance plans are generally uniform in nature, offering the same benefits to all employees or members of the group. However, the biggest advantage of Group Health Insurance is that it can be customized to meet unique needs of the company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group health insurance policy offers several other benefits employees cannot get to avail of on an individual basis. These benefits include coverage for pre-existing diseases. In case of a group health insurance policy, an individual does not have to wait for specific diseases to be covered (i.e. there is no waiting period), including maternity coverage. A customized insurance coverage can be enjoyed only with the group medical insurance scheme, making the employees feel more secure when it comes to health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the companies provide Group Health Insurance as a part of their Employee Welfare program. Every company, however, opts for a plan that is customized, based on their requirements.&nbsp;</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Group health insurance policies that provide maternity benefits have a 9-months waiting period before the person can claim the benefit.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hospital costs are dependent upon the type of room selected, e.g. fees for doctor consultation in single A.C. room would be higher when compared to the shared room in the hospital. Hence, insurance companies put conditions on room eligibility. All costs thereafter are payable as per the eligible room rent. Typical eligibility is 1% of sum assured as room rent cap.</p>                </div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So if for instance, one had a health policy with sum assured of Rs. 4 Lakhs, and a room eligibility of up to Rs. 4000, then the claim payable would be limited to Rs. 2 Lakhs.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">A pre-existing disease is an ailment or sign of an ailment present before the inception of the insurance policy.

The same is valid in case one has a problem of severe blood pressure abnormalities, which can also be classified as a pre-existing disease in the name of cardiovascular issue.</p>                </div>

Some other insurers would have a lower criterion of 3 years. Pre-existing medical conditions are permanently excluded before policy issuance. This is in order to prevent any fraud or misuse so that people do not buy insurance to over pre-existing diseases.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It depends on the demographic to be covered and the benefits you want to offer to your group members. For instance, if the group includes youngsters who don&rsquo;t have a medical history, including coverage for a single person, the benefits of the policy are comparatively less important. On the other hand, if the group has an average age of 40 with parents covered, then the significance of this benefit is much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, it is dependent on the group&rsquo;s policy as well as on the cost it wishes to incur. Some group members might be entitled to the benefits of the policy only after they have been with the system for 4+ years. At the same time, this benefit comes only at an additional cost.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the key benefits that young employees value in the Group Health Insurance (Group Mediclaim) provided by the company is the Maternity Benefit.&nbsp; There are several aspects to the Maternity benefit that should be considered while designing and purchasing the group health insurance plan. These aspects are covered below:</p>                </div>

                <div class="ansData">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The maternity sum assured is different from the overall sum assured of the group mediclaim policy. This sum assured is fixed different for Normal and Caesarean delivery. Generally, companies provide higher sum assured for Caesarean delivery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The market average is to provide 25,000 as sum assured for Normal and 35,000 for C-Sec delivery. While most Insurance companies limit the benefit to 50,000, some would provide as high as 100,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Group insurance plans for young group offers maternity benefits. Hence HR managers have to evaluate the extent of benefit to be offered carefully.</p>                </div>

                <div class="ansData">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In case your policy has co-pay, it is generally not applicable for the maternity claims. The rational being that benefit is already capped. However, it is important for your Insurance Broker to clearly specify this in the policy terms since ambiguity later can lead to claim disputes and employee dissatisfaction.</p>                </div>

                <div class="ansData">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Group Health Insurance generally does not cover self-inflicted, or fertility related treatment. Similarly, voluntary abortion is not covered under Group Health Insurance by most Insurance companies. However, emergency abortion, i.e. for the life-saving purpose is covered by most insurance companies. It is important to note that each company has its own view on this, so important to get it clarified through your insurance broker.</p>                </div>

                <div class="ansData">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">In a standard policy, a newborn is not covered under the health insurance policy unless it is at least 90 days old (some companies increase the restriction to make it 150 days). However, one can get it customized to cover a newborn from Day 1. Within this, the employer has a choice to fix the sum assured for the newborn for the period between 0-90 days. It can be either the maternity sum assured or the sum assured available to the employee. It is highly recommended that the higher sum assured should be chosen, since if any complication arises to the newborn, the maternity sum assured would be highly inadequate.</p>                </div>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the individual policies that offer maternity benefit have a waiting period of 3-4 years. However in a Group Health Insurance (or Group mediclaim) the waiting period comes down to 9 months i.e., the member should be at least be enrolled in the policy for nine months. This condition for 9 months waiting period can also be waived if desired by the company. This would mean that from Day 1 of the policy, the enrolled members can claim the maternity benefit.</p>                </div>
