<p>For an individual, life insurance is the most-safest and securest way to protect their family/ dependents against financial contingencies that may arise post their untimely demise.</p>
<h2>What is Life Insurance Policy?</h2>
<p><img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="https://www.policybazaar.com/images/life-insurance-by-age-income-responsibilities.jpg" alt="Life Insurance" width="350" height="300" /></p>
<p>A life insurance policy is an agreement between an insurance company &amp; a policyholder, that offers financial coverage under which the insurer guarantees to pay a certain amount to the nominated beneficiary in the unfortunate event of the insured person demise during the term of life insurance plans. In exchange, the policyholder agrees to pay a predefined amount of money as premium either on a regular basis or as a single premium. If covered by the policy, coverage will be provided for critical illness as well.</p>
<p>Since it provides enhanced insurance coverage, it attracts an enhanced insurance premium.</p>
<h2>Online Life Insurance Plans</h2>
<p>True to its name, online <em><i>life insurance plans</i></em> are available exclusively online. An online life insurance plan also offers death benefit in the form of a high sum assured at a low premium. Moreover, online <em><i>life insurance plans</i></em> also offer several tax benefits under <em><i>Section 80C</i></em> of the <em><i>Income Tax Act, 1961</i></em>.</p>
<h2>Who Determines Life Insurance Premium?</h2>
<p>The insurance company determines the premium payable by the policyholder to the insurance company. Having said that, the insurance buyer gets to select the term of the policy and the sum assured.</p>
<p>In order to calculate the sum assured of a <em><i>life insurance policy</i></em>, the insurer takes various factors such as your lifestyle, occupation, number of dependents, finances, sum assured etc. into consideration.</p>
<p><strong><em><b><i>Note- </i></b></em></strong>There is no premium calculator that can calculate the worth of human life.</p>

<h2>Why it is Important to Buy Life insurance policy?</h2>
<p>A life insurance policy acts as a financial net in case of eventuality linked with human life, such as disability, accident, death, etc.</p>
<p>In case of sudden demise of the primary breadwinner of a family, apart from the emotional trauma, his/her family will be at the risk of a financial crunch due to loss of income.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that one's family doesn't have to make any compromises due to financial crunch, one should buy a suitable life coverage plan. It will help his/her family to sail through the tough times with dignity.</p>
<p>Here is why it is important to buy a life insurance policy:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Hedge against Unpredictability- </strong>Life is unpredictable; one can't predict when his/her life will come to an end. If it were up to people, nobody would want to leave without ensuring the financial security of his/her family. Sadly, it's not up to them. In order to take care of their family’s financial future, one must buy a life policy and be a step ahead. Doing so will ensure that the financial goals set for his/her family can be accomplished even when he/she isn't around.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Cushion- </strong>It provides much-needed financial support to the insured's family by compensating for the loss of income.</li>
<li><strong>Debt-Proof Future- </strong>The sudden demise of a breadwinner is nothing short of a catastrophe for their family. While it is an emotional crisis initially, it can get converted into a financial crisis in no time. With the help of life coverage, any outstanding debt such as a motor loan, personal loan, home loan, etc. can be taken care of.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishment of Retirement Goals- </strong>A life policy is a perfect option to accomplish long-term goals including retirement goals. Some life insurance plans offer diverse investment opportunities and some insurance plans offer performance-based dividends.</li>
<li><strong>Mental Peace- </strong>Life policy offers much-needed peace of mind to the policyholder by assuring the financial future of their family. Even a basic life coverage plan helps to generate corpus to take care of the future financial needs of the insured's family.</li>
<li><strong>Savings Tool-</strong>In case a policyholder opts for a unit-linked plan, they will have to pay an enhanced insurance premium. This extra amount of money is invested in the insured's preferred fund and consequently acts as a savings tool.</li>
<li><strong>Children's Future Expenses- </strong>A life policy takes care of all the future expenses of a policyholder's children such as education and wedding expenses. These days, the cost of raising a child is sky-high. Not just that, even getting admission in a reputed college costs a bomb. The life insurance policy ensures that the policyholder's children don't have to make any compromises for their education and personal needs.</li>
<li><strong>Business Security- </strong>While some life insurance plans fulfill the financial needs of the insured and his/her family, there are some insurance plans available in the market that offer support to the insured's business. Such plans also enable a business partner to buy the share of the deceased business partner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the insurance buyer knows what they want, the next step is to shop around and compare <em><i>life insurance plans</i></em> that fulfill their insurance requirement. The <em><i>best insurance policy</i></em> is the one that fulfills the needs of the insurance buyer.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Life Insurance Plans</h2>
<p>The perks of buying a life insurance policy are beyond protecting policyholder’s family in tough times. Undoubtedly, it is a necessity for a breadwinner to safeguard their dependents in case of their unfortunate and untimely demise, accident or physical disabilities that lead to a loss of income. Having said that, there is a long list of other benefits that make life insurance plans a must-have.</p>
<p>Sadly, most people are not aware of the many benefits offered by a life plan. All they care about are the death and disability benefits. However, there is plenty of other benefits offered by life policies such as maturity benefits, tax benefits etc.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the benefits offered by life insurance plans:</p>
<h3>Acts as a Loan Collateral</h3>
<p>Till date, many people don't know that life policies can also be used as loan collateral. Based on the type of the life insurance policy and the surrender value, the policyholder can opt for a loan from a bank or NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company) as per applicable terms and conditions.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong><b>Loan Amount: </b></strong>Generally, the loan amount is a percentage of the surrender value of the life policy and it can go up to 90%. There are few companies that only allow for a loan up to 50 percent of the total premium amount paid by the policyholder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Online Payment Discount</h3>
<p>Most individuals are unaware of the online payment benefit (the payment mode chosen by an individual drastically affects the premium of a life insurance policy). As a matter of fact, an insurance company's administrative costs considerably go down when an individual opts to pay his premiums online.</p>
<p>This is because there is no paperwork-related cost involved. Also, the life insurer is able to save a significant amount on the commission, which they pay to the agents for offline insurance buying and renewing.</p>
<p><strong>Please Note-</strong> This discount varies from company to company.</p>
<h3>Discount as per the Opted Payment Periodicity</h3>
<p>Almost every life insurer offers various payment periodicities to its policyholders- annual, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly mode.</p>
<p>If a policyholder chooses to pay the policy premium on an annual basis, the company can use it for investment purpose that automatically means more profits and benefits for the company.</p>
<p>Once a policyholder chooses the payment periodicity, this discount is often already included in the premium rate charged by the life insurer.</p>
<h3>Taking Care of Business</h3>
<p>There are some life insurers that provide an option for policyholders who own a business. In the case of policyholder’s demise, their business partners can purchase the policyholder’s share without any hassles. In this scenario, the business partner will simply have to sign an agreement with the life insurer and the pay-out received after selling the policyholder's share will be given to their dependents.</p>
<p>However, it's important to understand that the nominee or the dependents of the policyholder won’t get a stake in the company.</p>
<h3>Tax Benefits</h3>
<p>For paying a life policy premium, a policyholder is eligible for a tax rebate under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961. Irrespective for oneself, their spouse or their children, the premium paid for parents and in-laws is exempted.</p>
<p>This benefit is offered by all the life insurers - be it private sector life insurers or public sector life insurers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the maturity benefit of life policies also qualifies for tax deductions under Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>
<h2>Details of Tax Benefit</h2>
<p>The life insurance plans not just offer financial protection to the policyholder's family or dependents, but also offer the advantage of tax benefit. Here are the tax benefits offered under a life insurance plan:</p>
<h3>Tax Deductions Under Section 80C</h3>
<p>There are various investment options that provide the benefit of tax exemption U/S 80C of Income Tax Act. Under ITA, the Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) and individuals can avail the tax exemption.</p>
<p>Under different sections of IT Act such as 80C, 80CC, and 80CCE, the policyholder can avail the maximum tax exemption of up to Rs.1, 50, 000.</p>
<p>The premiums paid up to a maximum 20 percent of the sum assured amount are applicable for deductions. In case, the premium amount paid by the insured, in a particular financial year, is more than 20 percent of the actual sum insured, it does not qualify for tax benefit. In addition to that, policies issued before March 31, 2012, are applicable for tax this exemption.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for the insurance policies issued on or after April 1, 2012, the tax exemption is only applicable for the premiums payable not exceeding 10 percent of the actual Sum assured.</p>
<p>In case, the policyholder claims tax exemption under Section 80C and if the life insurance policy has been terminated or canceled within a period of 2 years from policy issuance, then the tax benefit availed by the insured will be reversed. This type of tax deduction is valid on all types of life insurance plans, except Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs).</p>
<p>For ULIPs, if the insured claims tax exemption U/S 80C and if the plan has been terminated or canceled within the initial 5 years of the policy tenure, then the tax exemption availed by the insured will be reversed.</p>
<h2>Eligibility for Tax Deduction</h2>

<p>Here are the details of the aforementioned plans:</p>
<h2>Term Insurance Plans</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/term-insurance/">Term insurance</a> is the most basic form of life coverage. It is affordable insurance that one can buy easily, without any hassles.</p>
<p>Simply put, a term insurance plan offers death cover for a stipulated time period. God forbid, in the event of the sudden demise of the insured during the policy tenure, the insurance provider offers a pre-decided death benefit as a lump sum, as a monthly/ annual pay-out, or as combined benefits to the nominee. The best term plan offers comprehensive coverage at a competitive premium.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Term Life Insurance Plans</h2>
<h3>Death Benefit</h3>
<p>The death benefit is paid as monthly payouts, a lump sum, or both.</p>
<p><strong><b>Please Note-</b></strong> No payout is paid in case the insured outlives the policy tenure.</p>
<h3>Additional Riders</h3>
<p>In order to enhance the insurance coverage offered by a basic life policy, term plans come with various optional riders. Depending on their expectations, the policyholder can opt for the same.</p>
<h2>Unit Linked Insurance Plans</h2>
<p>A unit-linked insurance plan or <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/ulip-plans/">ULIP</a> is a type of life coverage plan that offers a perfect blend of insurance &amp; investment. It comes with a long-term investment opportunity along with valuable investment flexibility.</p>
<p>The premium paid towards a ULIP is partly used as a risk-cover for life coverage plan and the remainder is invested in market funds such as debts, equities, bonds, market funds, hybrid funds etc. The selection of the market funds depends purely on the risk appetite of the insurance buyer. Based on that, the insurer invests the amount in the capital market as per the insured's preference.</p>
<h3>Benefits of ULIPs</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Best of Both Worlds- </strong>It offers the benefits of life coverage as well as investment.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Investment- </strong>Based on the risk appetite, it offers various investment options for insurance buyers.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Autonomy- </strong>It offers complete autonomy of selecting the preferred investment option to the insurance buyers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Endowment Plans</h2>
<p>Endowment plans are also known as traditional life insurance plans. These plans come with an element of saving. As compared to the risk factor of other investment products, the risk involved is lower (so are the returns).</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/endowment-policy/">endowment policy</a> is a combination of a life coverage plan and savings plan. It invests a particular amount in life coverage and the remaining amount is invested by the provider. In case the policyholder outlives the policy term, the insurance provider offers a maturity benefit to him/her. Furthermore, some life insurance endowment policies may offer bonuses on pre-specified periods. If applicable, the bonuses are paid either to the policyholder at the time of policy maturity or to the nominee in case of a death claim.</p>
<h3>Benefit of Endowment Plans</h3>
<p><strong><b>Return on Investment-</b></strong> It acts as a long-term financial planning tool that offers returns on investment at the time of maturity.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Money Back </b></strong><strong><b>Life Insurance Plans</b></strong></h2>
<p>True to its name, this type of life coverage plan offers a stipulated percentage of the assured sum. It is paid back to the policyholder at pre-decided intervals. This payback benefit is known as a survival benefit.</p>
<p>Money back is the best type of life insurance policy for individuals who want their investments to be accompanied by an element of liquidity. Furthermore, these plans are eligible for bonuses as declared by the provider (if any).</p>
<h3>Benefit of Money Back Plans</h3>
<p><strong><b>Accomplishment of Short -Term Financial Goals-</b></strong> It acts as a tool to accomplish short-term financial goals and a golden opportunity to earn a return on investment at the time of maturity.</p>
<h2>Whole Life Insurance Plans</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/general-info/articles/a-guide-on-whole-life-insurance-policy/">whole life insurance</a> plan offers life coverage as long as the insured lives. There are a few providers that offer life coverage up to 100 years of age. Contrary to the coverage offered by term plans, this plan offers extensive insurance coverage.</p>
<p>The sum assured is computed when the life coverage plan is purchased and is payable to the nominee after the demise of the insured. Along with the sum assured, bonuses (if any) are also paid to the nominee. It is one of the best life insurance policies that offer coverage up to whole life at low premiums.</p>
<h2>Whole Life ULIP</h2>
<p>A variant of whole life insurance is available in the market that clubs the benefits of life insurance plans with ULIPs. A whole life ULIP offers extensive coverage along with high returns.</p>
<p><strong><b>Please Note-</b></strong> In case the policyholder outlives the 100 years of age, the insurance provider pays the benefit of matured endowment coverage to the policyholder.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Whole Life Insurance Plan</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Coverage- </strong>It offers lifelong insurance coverage to the policyholder.</li>
<li><strong>Partial Withdrawals- </strong>Upon the completion of the premium payment period, it offers the facility of partial withdrawals</li>
<li><strong>Age No Bar- </strong>It comes without any age limit with respect to the eligibility criteria.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Child Plans</h2>
<p>A child plan acts as a tool to generate funds for the policyholder’s child. A child plan helps one build a corpus for their child that can be used for the child’s education and wedding. Generally, child plans either provide benefits as installments on an annual basis or a 1-time payout once the insured child is 18 years of age.</p>
<p>In an unfortunate event of the untimely demise of the policyholder during the policy term, immediate premium payment is payable by the insurer. In such cases, some insurance providers waive off future premiums but the plan continues till the opted policy term.</p>
<h3>Child Plan Benefits</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Secured Future- </strong>Even if the parents of the insured child pass away, it ensures that the future of the insured child is safe and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Support- </strong>It helps parents accumulate funds for major events in their child's life such as education, wedding etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Retirement Plans</h2>
<p>A retirement plan, also known as an annuity or <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/life-insurance/pension-plans/">pension plan</a>, helps the insured accumulate a corpus for their retirement. Typically, retirement plans provide benefits in the form of installments on an annual basis or a 1-time pay-out once insured is 60 years of age. In case the insured outlives the policy term, the plan offers vesting benefit. In case of the insured's demise, it offers the death benefit to the policy nominee.</p>
<p><strong><b>Note-</b></strong> In case of the insured's demise while the policy is active, the life insurer pays a pre-decided amount to insured's nominee.</p>
<h3>Retirement Plan Benefits</h3>

<h2>Life Insurance Riders &amp; Their Importance</h2>
<h3>What are Life Insurance Riders?</h3>
<p>These riders offer add-on benefits offered by the life insurers that help to enhance the base insurance coverage. However, without knowing the types of riders available in the market, one shouldn't randomly opt for the same just for the sake of increasing the cover amount of the life coverage plan.</p>
<p>Choosing the right life insurance rider is as crucial as buying life coverage plan. After all, no one wants to regret an insurance decision. That's why one must take time and expert's advice before opting for a life coverage insurance rider.</p>
<p><strong><b>Types of Life Insurance Riders </b></strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the rider options available for policyholders:</p>
<h3><strong>Accidental Death Benefit Rider</strong></h3>
<p>With this rider, in case of the accidental death of the insured, the nominee will receive the basic sum assured amount along with the additional accidental death benefit. In many cases, the policyholder doesn’t pass away on-the-spot, so most of the insurance companies set a time period after the incident to extend the offered coverage.</p>
<p>Let’s say, if the policyholder passes away after 100 days of the accident, the nominee will still receive the sum assured. That's why it is imperative to check the life insurance policy clause carefully at the time of opting for a rider.</p>
<p>As accident can happen anywhere, anytime, everyone should ensure the financial future of their family. While anybody can opt for this rider, it is a must-buy for those who:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Commute and travel by car, bike, public or commercial vehicles, on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Frequently go on business trips or if the job involves physical work in a factory or on-site civil work.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Accidental Total and Permanent Disability Rider</strong></h3>
<p>Due to total temporary or permanent disability in case of an accident, if the insured is unable to earn a daily income, this rider provides financial assistance to their family in the form of a monthly income. The rider benefit may vary plan to plan and it is offered for a pre-decided time period.</p>
<p>For instance, some companies offer rider benefits for 5 years to 10 years from the occurrence of the accident. In case of the death of the insured during the policy term, the beneficiary would receive the outstanding sum assured amount.</p>
<p>This rider is important to buy for the individuals who:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Commute and travel on a daily basis by bike, car, public transport, train, or commercial vehicle.</li>
<li>Do physical work in on-site civil work or factories or travel frequently for business.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Critical Illness Rider</h3>
<p>This rider benefit offered by life insurance plans covers major critical ailments like cancer, heart attack, kidney failure, stroke, coma, paralysis, etc. As the coverage may differ from insurer to insurer, it is important to check the list of illnesses covered by the company.</p>
<p>The life insurer offers the rider benefits upon the diagnosis of the covered critical illness. Though many of the above listed critical illnesses may not cause immediate death, the treatment could cost a bomb. Under this rider, the insured can use the sum assured to pay for the treatment expenses. However, the payout may vary as some insurer offers 100% of the basic sum assured and others don't. The only condition is that the policyholder will have to survive the waiting period.</p>
<p>As no one can ensure 100 percent guarantee against a critical illness, this rider can be opted by:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Top-level officers working under extreme work stress</li>
<li>Chain-smokers</li>
<li>Someone leading an unhealthy lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Waiver of Premium Rider</h3>
<p>If the insured is unable to pay the premium due to any disability that leaves him/her with no income, the life insurance policy will be terminated. In such cases, the insured wouldn't be offered any compensation. In such a situation, how will their family manage their finances without a regular source of income?</p>
<p>In such a situation, waiver of premium rider acts as life a savior, as all the future premiums of the life insurance policy will be waived off and the policy will remain in force.</p>
<p>In case the premiums are not paid due to the death or accidental disability of the policyholder, the premium for the base policy and riders will be waived off and the policy will continue.</p>
<p>While this rider can be opted along with critical illness and accidental total and permanent disability rider, the insured can opt for it separately. As uncertainties can't be predicted, one should consider buying this life coverage insurance rider if they are a daily commuter or work on on-site civil work that involves physical work.</p>
<h3>Accelerated Death Benefit Rider</h3>
<p>This rider acts as a savior in case the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness such as cancer, AIDS, leukemia, Ebola etc., which may decrease their lifespan. In such cases, the life insurer pays a portion of the base sum assured in advance. This can be utilized for the treatment or for paying monthly household expenses. The remaining sum assured will be paid to the family at the time of death of the insured to secure their financial future.</p>
<p><strong><b>Note-</b></strong> Before taking any decision, a thorough analysis of lifestyle or surroundings is required. Based on this, insurance seekers should decide whether they need this rider or not.</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong><b>Term Rider: </b></strong>This rider offers a monthly income or lump sum to the beneficiary in the event of the premature death of the insured. The benefit can be equal to the base sum assured which is pre-determined by the insurer.</li>
<li><strong><b>Hospital Cash Rider: </b></strong>Under this rider, a fixed amount is paid in case of emergency/planned hospitalization. The benefit amount, terms and conditions, and sum assured may vary from insurer to insurer. This rider benefit offered by life insurers for those policyholders who want coverage for expenses related to emergency hospitalization.</li>
<li><strong><b>Surgical Care Rider: </b></strong>Under this rider, a lump sum amount is paid if the insured undergoes an unavoidable surgery in India. However, the rider benefit may vary plan to plan or severity of the surgery. This rider benefit can be opted by anyone who wants to cover the expenses for surgery in case of any eventualities. This helps in avoiding any out-of-pocket expenses that may burn a hole in one's pocket.</li>

<h2>Inclusions and Exclusions of a Life Insurance Policy</h2>
<h3>Inclusions</h3>
<p>Generally, the inclusions are mentioned in the policy copy. The insurance experts recommend the insurance buyers to carefully go through the fine print of the policy copy.</p>
<h3>Exclusions</h3>
<p>Though a life insurance policy offers financial cover against multiple eventualities, there are certain situations in which the insurance company doesn’t provide the insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the some of the common exclusions of life plans:</p>
<h2>Death as a Result of Lifestyle Diseases</h2>
<p>Do not conceal any health-related information while filling out your application form. Lifestyle-related habits like smoking, drinking and other health risks associated with them are some of the crucial factors that decide your premium.</p>
<p>People with coronary heart disease, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity etc. are more vulnerable to health complications. Also, smokers are exposed to the risk of developing various diseases. And, this is the reason why smokers need to pay a higher premium amount for a life insurance policy as compared to non-smokers as they impose a higher risk on the insurer. In addition to that, even your driving habits are accounted for.</p>
<p>The insurance company will decide whether to accept or reject your application based on your lifestyle habits.</p>
<p><strong><b>Please Note- </b></strong>Make sure that you accurately declare your medical history to your insurer.</p>
<h3>Self-inflicted Injuries</h3>
<p>Accidental deaths resulting from deliberate self-harm, self-abuse, or psychological disorders are usually not covered under life coverage insurance. The beneficiary of the policy cannot file a claim if the death of the policyholder takes place due to any such reason.</p>
<h3>Participating in Extreme Sports Activities</h3>
<p>Death due to participating in adventure sports like paragliding, scuba diving, trekking, water-sports activities, rock-climbing, sky-diving etc. are not covered under a life insurance policy.</p>
<p>However, there are some life insurers in India that have tried to fill the gap amid the increasing popularity of adventure sports/activities and offered insurance coverage in our country. However, this extended coverage comes at a higher premium cost.</p>
<h3>Man-Made Disasters</h3>
<p>The claims arising due to riots or war come under man-made disasters. For any damages caused due to negligence on the part of human beings, no coverage is provided.</p>
<h3>Loss of life due to HIV and STDs</h3>
<p>In case of the untimely death of the policyholder due to sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS, no insurance coverage will be provided.</p>
<h3>Intoxication and Overdose of Drugs</h3>
<p>Consumption of drugs and overdose of alcohol and medicines can impose serious health risks and even result in death. If the death of a policyholder occurs due to drug overdose, it will lead to rejection of the life coverage insurance claim.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should be responsible. Else the dependent members of your family will not be provided with any death benefit by the company, and the purpose of buying a life insurance policy will not be served.</p>
<h3>Criminal Intent/Illegitimate Activities</h3>
<p>Risk arising due to involvement in any unlawful activity or intentional violation of the law is beyond the scope of coverage.</p>
<h2>Need for Reading the Fine-Print Carefully</h2>
<p>It is advised that you thoroughly read the life insurance policy's document and understand all the terms and conditions. It can be a little monotonous but it will be worth the weariness. Opting for a policy without going through the inclusions and exclusions can cost you more than you can imagine.</p>
<p>Nobody wants their loved ones to face financial crises in their absence. So, it is suggested to be aware of all the inclusions and exclusions of the life insurance policy. Knowing the policy inclusions and exclusions will enable you to know what not to do to ensure smooth claim processing.</p>
<h2>The Right Age to Buy Life Coverage Insurance</h2>
<p>Life coverage insurance is the simplest form of insurance that helps a policyholder to secure the financial future their family following his/her unfortunate demise. It can be purchased anytime, but the premium of a life coverage insurance plan is formulated on the basis of age, lifestyle, and financial goals of the insurance buyer. It is best to buy life coverage insurance as early as possible. The reason is one can avail the plan at an economical price as low risks are associated with younger age.</p>
<p>If the advice of financial experts is to be considered, the starting month of the financial year (April) is the best time to reassess one's financial plans. On the other hand, if one considers the age factor, the below pointers should be kept in mind:</p>
<h3>At the age of 20</h3>
<p>The 20s is the most crucial, yet sensitive phase of one's life. People start their professional career and start making their financial decisions on their own. Though one may have less financial responsibilities, they are bound to increase with passing time.</p>
<p>In this regard, a life coverage plan helps a person mitigate financial risks in case of their untimely demise. One big benefit of purchasing life coverage insurance at this age is that one can opt for a comprehensive plan at a low premium since the risk to the policyholder's life is on the lower side. In other words, the younger the policyholder, the lesser the premiums will be.</p>
<p>In line with this, one can avail life coverage insurance with a sum assured of Rs. 50 lakh for a yearly premium starting from Rs. 3776.</p>
<h3>At the Age of the 30s</h3>
<p>This is the time when most people get married and start a family. With this, the financial responsibilities also increase manifold. Not only people start thinking about securing the future of their child(ren) but also worry about financial liabilities like a car loan, home loan or other long-term commitments that require their utmost attention. However, their income usually increases with age and the standard of living also improves. In turn, making the expenses to spiral up.</p>
<p>This is the time that one thinks of buying life coverage insurance to protect the financial future of the family. One can go for a term plan with a monthly income option. This plan allows availing a monthly/ lump sum amount to pay-off (pay off) the debts (if any). This could be a great financial backing for the family and can help to bear day-to-day expenses in the absence of the sole earning member due to their demise.</p>
<h3>At the age of 40</h3>
<p>At the age of 40s, usually, people have to take care of long-term debts like home loan, car loan, etc. Moreover, responsibilities like a child's higher education, retirement planning, healthcare expenditure for elderly parents' etc., need a considerable amount of money. Thus, one within the age group of 40 requires a comprehensive cover that secures the future of his/her family. Buying a plan with a larger sum assured is recommended at this age.</p>
<p>A 40-year male non-smoker can purchase a policy with sum assured of Rs.50 lakh, the premium will cost around Rs.7198/year. The same sum assured at the age of 50, will be available approximately at Rs.12,626/year. So, one shouldn't delay buying a life coverage insurance.</p>
<h3>At the age of 50</h3>
<p>When someone is or more than 50 years old, the premium of life or term insurance generally doubles as compared to the premium charged from 30 years old. While the premium is at this age, it is recommended that one should buy life coverage insurance, especially if he/she is the breadwinner of the family or has huge financial liabilities to pay off.</p>
<h3>At the Age 65</h3>
<p>Many may think that over 65 years of age, they won't be able to avail term or life policy. But, it's not true. The only thing he/she has to compromise on is the policy term. At this age, opting for a 30-year plan doesn't make any sense nor would one get the approval. At the age of 65 or more, one can go for a term or whole life plan that offers complete financial protection when there is no or less inflow of money.</p>
<h2>How Does Age Affect Life Insurance Premium Rates?</h2>
<p>While purchasing a policy, it is very important to compare life insurance plans online and understand the process of premium calculation. As we have earlier mentioned, there are various factors that determine the premium rate of a life insurance policy. Age is one of the most important factors that play a vital role in determining the premium amount.</p>
<p>The premium amount rises by 8%-10% every year due to the increase in the insured's age. So, it is always beneficial to purchase a life insurance policy while one's young. If the insurance buyer is young, the premium rates of the policy will be lower as compared to the premium rates for someone older. This is because young individuals tend to be less prone to develop/ contract life-threatening diseases. For the insurance provider, they are less of a liability. Moreover, purchasing a life insurance policy at a young age can help the insured save a lot of money in the long run.</p>
<p>As a person grows older, their life expectancy decreases. Thus, they become riskier to the insurer. Rather than increasing the policy premium every year, the insurance company spreads the premiums one would pay over 10, 20 or 30 years depending on the entry age of the insured and averages them into one amount. So, the premium amount paid by the insured remains the same every year. However, the rate increases every year by 5-8% if an individual is in his/her 40s and 9-12% if an individual is above 50 years of age.</p>
<p>If a person waits to buy life coverage insurance at a later stage in life, then he/she will end up paying a higher premium. Besides, purchasing a life coverage insurance plan at an older age can also lead to more hassles during the application process. The insurer might ask the insurance buyer to undergo extra tests like ECG and cognitive testing for dementia before issuing the policy.</p>
<p>It just means that the insured will have to pay a little extra premium. Having said that, paying a little extra in order to safeguard the future of the loved ones is wiser than not having a protection plan at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are many life cover policies that are designed to fulfill the requirements of the individuals in their golden years. As per applicable terms and conditions, these types of life plans may cover accidental death as well.</p>
<p>In case of guaranteed whole life coverage insurance, the insured does not have to undergo any medical tests and may be covered for a higher sum assured. This type of life insurance is designed to protect the family of the insured from the financial burden that may arise after the insured passes away.</p>
<p>For life plans that provide accidental death coverage, age is not a factor that decides policy premium. Plus the insured does not have to undergo any medical tests. However, life cover against accidental death can only be provided to the policyholder if they have opted for accidental rider benefit along with the basic policy.</p>
<h2>How Much Insurance Cover Does One Need?</h2>
<p>If one has dependents to take care of and insufficient funds to fulfill their needs in one's absence, one needs a comprehensive life insurance policy.</p>
<p>The major question is- how can one calculate the income replacement that would be required for their family post their demise? Although it's the kind of question that nobody wants to ask, when it comes to buying life coverage insurance, one should certainly have a clear answer.</p>
<p>There is no denying the fact that the primary purpose of a life coverage policy is to provide financial aid to the policyholder's dependents in case of his/her untimely demise. Hence, the cover amount should be adequate to clear up all dues and provide a regular income source for the family of the insured.</p>
<p>The amount of life coverage insurance that one will need actually depends upon the individual's insurance expectations and the type of plan s/he is looking for. For example, one can opt for a life coverage insurance to secure their mortgage, cover debts, or provide a lump sum amount to his/her loved ones to help them maintain their standard of living.</p>
<p>The following factors can help an insurance buyer decide how much insurance coverage they need:</p>
<h2>How Much Does one owe?</h2>
<p>The amount of debt one has to pay should be an important factor while finalizing the sum assured for a life insurance policy. This is because one would not want his/her family to deal with debt collectors or struggle to repay the debt.</p>
<p>For instance, Mr Kumar has a debt of Rs.20 Lakhs and he opted for a life coverage insurance with a sum assured of least Rs.50 lakhs. This way his family will be able to repay the loan and have a substantial amount of money to live their lives comfortably. In order to ensure that the policy will cover the debt, Mr Kumar regularly pays the interest on his debt to safeguard it from snowballing into a large sum.</p>
<h2>How Much Regular Income does one's Dependents Need to maintain their Standard of Living?</h2>
<p>The current lifestyle plays a vital role in determining the cover amount one is going to need for his/her life coverage insurance.</p>
<p>Let's say Mr Rohit earns Rs. 10 lakh a year (after tax and other deductions from his salary). In case he is not around, the money he used to spend on himself can be deducted. Hence the required income can be an estimated 80 percent of Rs. 10 lakh, i.e. Rs. 8 lakh. In this case, he will need a life insurance policy that will provide his family members with a minimum income replacement of Rs. 8 lakh per annum.</p>
<p>The next crucial step is deciding for how long his family members are going to need this income. Keeping inflation in mind, the sum assured of Rs.1 crore should be sufficient for 15 years, and Rs 1.5 crores for the next 25 years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to determine the time period for which would need income replacement for, he will need to estimate the age at which his investments and savings will make him financially independent. He can either use the traditional retirement age of 60 years or contact a financial advisor to do the calculations for him.</p>
<p>If Mr Rohit's wife Ms Shikha is also working and he is partially dependent upon her income for his expenses, he can still follow the same principle for the income replacement. All he has to do is to keep an account for his wife's financial contribution to the family while calculating the cover amount of life insurance policy.</p>
<h3>Are there any Future Financial Liabilities to Take Care of?</h3>
<p>There may be certain future needs to keep in the account for (such as one's kids' higher education, wedding, etc.), while calculating the cover amount of life coverage insurance. One has to estimate the cost involved in these future expenditures and add them to the insurance cover.</p>
<p>It is advised to re-evaluate financial plans periodically to ensure that they have an adequate cover, especially on the occurrence of major life events such as buying a new house against a loan, child's birth, etc. One cannot follow the ‘one size fits all' approach to decide the coverage amount of life insurance policy. Besides one's personal finances, one also needs to have a fair idea of how much s/he can afford to pay as monthly premiums.</p>
<p>There is a range of affordable indemnity policies available and the market is offering various flexible options to the customers in the form of regular income pay-out or a lump sum amount. By making the right decision, one can easily get an affordable life insurance policy.</p>
<h2>Claim Settlement Ratios of Life Insurance Companies in India</h2>
<p>As of October 2018, 24 companies sell life insurance plans in India. Of all these 24 providers, the only provider under the public sector is the Life Insurance Cooperation of India. The rest of the 23 companies are either private providers or joint ventures between national or international insurance/finance companies and private or public sector banks/financial institutions.</p>
<p>Access to the life insurance sector was given to private life insurers in the year 2000. Also, most of the private insurers have partnered with international insurance companies to offer life insurance in India.</p>
<p>An important parameter to ensure the financial health of the insurance company is by checking its Claim Settlement Ratio.</p>
<h2>What is Claim Settlement Ratio?</h2>
<p>A Claim Settlement Ratio (CSR) is the ratio of the total number of claims that an insurance provider settles to the total number of claims receives in a year. CSR for life insurers is issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) of India, every year.</p>
<p>The formula to calculate the Claim Settlement Ratio is as follows:</p>
<p>Claim Settlement Ratio = Total number of claims paid by the insurer /Total number of claims received by the insurer * 100</p>
<p>For example, if the number of death claims received by the insurance provider is 1000, out of which it settles 980, the Claim Settlement Ration of that provider will be:</p>
<p>Claim Settlement Ratio = (980÷1000) x 100 = 98%</p>
<p>The higher the CSR of the insurer, the better it is for its customers.</p>
<h2>Claim Settlement Ratio of Life Insurance Providers for 2017-18</h2>
<p>As per IRDA, here is the Claim Settlement Ratio of various life insurance providers in India:</p>

<h2>When to File Claims for Life insurance plans?</h2>
<p>Filing a claim and getting the assured amount can be a cakewalk if all the necessary steps are taken care of. It is important to have the right approach to file a claim. Here's how nominees of the policyholder or policyholder can file a claim in India under the following scenarios:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Upon the demise of the policyholder</li>
<li>Upon maturity of the policy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Here is how to file a Claim In Case of Death</h2>
<p><strong><b>Inform the Insurance Company:</b></strong> Contact the insurer as soon as possible on their toll-free number or inform them over email. It is always preferable to inform the insurer directly over a call to initiate the process.</p>
<p><strong><b>Share Important Details:</b></strong> The beneficiary or the claimant while lodging a claim with the life insurer needs to share all the important details like:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Policy Number</li>
<li>Name of the policyholder</li>
<li>Place of death</li>
<li>Name of the claimant</li>
</ul>
<p>If the life insurance policy has been purchased offline, then the insurer would have provided a claim intimation form at the time of the policy purchase.</p>
<p>If it is an online insurance policy, it is simple to apply for the claim settlement through claim form online.</p>
<p><strong><b>Claim Processing:</b></strong> In case of accidental or natural death, the beneficiary or the nominee needs to submit all the supporting documents to the life insurer as a part of the claim process.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><b>Note- </b></strong>If someone other than the nominee files the claim, the insurance company can ask for the legal title of succession.</p>
<p><strong>Approval and Pay-out</strong></p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Once all the documents have been submitted, and the life insurer has verified it, the claim will be settled by the insurer.</li>

<h2>Here is how to file a Claim for the Maturity of the Life Insurance Policy</h2>
<p>If the insured outlives the policy term, he/she will be eligible to avail policy maturity benefits. However, the insured must make sure the policy is ongoing and that all the premiums have been duly paid.</p>
<p>Here is a simple process to file a maturity claim with minimal paperwork.</p>
<p>When the policy is about to mature, the life insurer generally intimates the policyholder at least 1-2 months in advance. All the details regarding the maturity date, maturity amount, and discharge voucher are provided to the insured.</p>
<p>The discharge voucher (similar to a receipt) has to be signed by the policyholder in the presence of the witnesses. The voucher is then sent back to the insurer along with the original policy bond, on the basis of which the policy maturity benefits are provided.</p>
<p>In case the policyholder has nominated another individual or entity for the life insurance policy, then the nominee must sign the discharge voucher to the insurer, in order to receive the claim amount.</p>
<p><strong><b>Points to Remember</b></strong></p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>This process is applicable only to the life plans eligible for maturity benefits like additional bonus, survival benefits, etc.</li>
<li>In the event of the demise of the policyholder after the date of policy maturity, but during the policy discharge procedures, it will be considered as a maturity claim. And the claim amount will be paid out to the nominees of the deceased policyholder.</li>
<li>At the time of buying a new life plan, the applicant must mention the details of previously purchased policy (if any). The insurance provider must be aware of the existing policy. Additionally, it can help the insurance seeker choose the right policy as per his/her needs. Otherwise, misrepresentation can be a reason for the rejection of death claim.</li>

<h2>Guidelines to Select the Best life insurance policy</h2>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of certain facts that one must consider to make the right purchase:</p>
<h3>Time Period</h3>
<p>It is one of the most important factors when it comes to selecting the best life insurance policy. If an individual wants a lifelong insurance coverage to take care of his/her family's well-being after his/her demise, then a whole life plan is the right choice.</p>
<p>If one needs a protection plan for a certain time period, he/she can go for term insurance. If one wants to save some funds for his/her children's education, then he/she can buy a child insurance plan.</p>
<p>To pay off his/her debts, one can buy a plan for that specific period. One can check out various types of plans like ULIPS, pension plans, money back plans, endowment plans etc., based on the time-period and individual needs.</p>
<p>It is recommended that one buys life coverage insurance at a younger age. This way, one will be able to get a high sum assured.</p>
<h3>Premium</h3>
<p>If one wants to buy life coverage insurance for <a href="https://www.policybazaar.com/income-tax/tax-saving-investments/">investment or tax-saving purposes</a>, then the premium is a crucial deciding factor. For example, the premium amount for endowment plans, Unit Linked Insurance Policies, and Whole life policies is on a higher side as compared to Term Insurance, Money Back Plans and Pension Plans.</p>
<p>It is important for one to know that if he/she is not able to pay the premium on time, then the opted life insurance policy will lapse.</p>
<h3>Dependents</h3>
<p>If one is the only breadwinner of the family, buying life coverage insurance should be his/her priority. The reason is, in such a case, one's family is dependent solely on his/her income, and nobody wants their loved ones to suffer due to loss of income in case of their untimely demise. Search for a plan that provides maximum coverage as per the number of dependents.</p>
<h3>Evaluate the Sum assured of Insurance</h3>
<p>One is recommended to have a fair estimate of their expected assured amount and then search for various life policy offered by different companies.</p>

<h2>How to Calculate Life Insurance Policy Premium?</h2>

<h2>Factors that Affect Life Insurance Policy Premium</h2>
<p>Before zeroing in on a life insurance policy, it is important to understand how the annual premium is computed. Irrespective of the type of policy, its annual premium depends upon various factors.</p>
<p>Listed below are some of the important factors that affect the premium of a life coverage insurance plan:</p>
<h3>Personal Factors</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Age- </strong>The age of the insurance buyer is directly proportional to the premium of the life insurance policy. So, it is best to get a policy as early as possible. Younger individuals are considered to be healthier as compared to older individuals and tend to pose a lower risk to the insurer. Thus, the premium of policy bought at a younger age lesser.</li>
<li><strong>Gender</strong>- According to studies, it has been found that women generally outlive men. Moreover, women generally go to the doctor more often than men. Thus, this marks women as low-risk individuals. As a result, they are charged a lower premium.</li>
<li><strong>Medical History (Self &amp; Family)</strong>- The medical history of an individual and his/her family is a significant factor that determines the premium amount of a life insurance policy. The premium amount of a policy depends on the severity of any past or current illnesses. For example, if an insurance buyer has recovered from a critical illness and is taking good care of his/her health then the insurer may charge a lower premium. However, the reduction of the premium rate depends on the insurer and type of life insurance policyan individual opts for. In certain cases, like cancer recovery, most of the companies do not offer a cover until the policy buyer proves that he/she has been in remission for a minimum of 5 years.</li>
<li><strong>Marital Status- </strong>Marital status of an individual plays a vital role while deciding the premium amount and processing the insurance application. If a couple buys a joint life insurance policy, then the premium of the policy will be higher as compared to the regular policy. It is important to keep in mind that in a joint plan the payout is provided on the basis of who passes away first and there is no payout in case of death of the second partner.</li>
<li><strong>Weight and Height- </strong>While determining the premium rate, the insurer considers the individual's BMI (Body Mass Index). As obese people are more prone to developing weight-related medical problems, they will have to pay a higher premium on their life insurance policy.</li>
<li><strong>Occupation</strong>- The occupation of an individual plays a significant role in determining the premium of the policy. For instance, pilots, soldiers, individuals working in the mining industry, oil and gas plants, etc. are considered as a high-risk profession. As a result, they will have to pay a higher premium.</li>
<li><strong>Debts</strong>- Any unpaid debts including mortgages, loans, credit card bills, etc. are one of the major factors that determine the amount of offered insurance protection.</li>
<li><strong>Drinking and Smoking- </strong>An insurance company will charge a heavy premium from smokers regardless he/she is a light smoker or a heavy smoker. Thus, this results in a higher premium amount. Similarly, those who regularly consume alcohol will be charged a higher premium. It is because the consumption of alcohol exposes them to the risk of developing alcohol-related diseases.</li>
<li><strong>International Travel- </strong>If the life coverage insurance buyer is a regular traveler and visits places that pose potential health risks, or have a high crime rate, acts of terror, s/he may be charged a higher premium.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insurer Related Factors</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Operating Cost- </strong>The total operational cost that the insurer incurs like rent, maintenance, legal fees, salaries, agents' commission, etc. affects the premium calculation of life policies.</li>
<li><strong>Interest- </strong>For certain policies, the company invests the premium in real estate, bonds, stocks, etc. under the assumption that the insured will earn a particular rate of interest on these investments. This interest-earning is another important factor considered while calculating the premium rate of a life coverage insurance plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Policy Related Factors</h3>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Whole Life Vs. Term-</strong> As whole life coverage insurance policies provide comprehensive coverage until death; they generally attracts higher premiums as compared to basic term plan that provides coverage only for a fixed duration.</li>
<li><strong>Decreasing Pay-outs- </strong>The life insurance policy premium calculation also depends upon whether an individual wants to have coverage decreased year after year or have a fixed cover for the entire tenure of the policy.</li>
<li><strong>Coverage- </strong>In case an individual opts for joint life coverage, the premium amount of the policy tends to be higher. It is because the plan is more likely to receive a claim request at some point. Moreover, a policy that provides critical illness cover like heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, etc. will also charge high premium rates. The premium rates are on the higher side for individuals above 60 years of age or those suffering from any pre-existing diseases because they are more likely to file claims.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Illustration of Calculation of Life Insurance Policy Premium</h2>
<p>Life insurance premium can be calculated in a matter of a few seconds by using a premium calculator. The example mentioned below will help you understand how:</p>
<p>The premium calculator computes premium on the basis of various factors. Using the example of the New Endowment Plan, let’s understand what the required factors are:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Type of Plan: </strong>New Endowment Plan</li>
<li><strong>Age of Policy Buyer: </strong>38 years</li>
<li><strong>Term of Plan: </strong>20 years</li>
<li><strong>Sum Assured:</strong> 10 lakhs</li>
<li><strong>Accident Rider/Benefit</strong>: Yes/ Selected*</li>
</ul>
<p>*The Accident Rider offers an additional cover for death caused due to an accident (above the base insurance plan) by charging a nominal premium on the base premium.</p>
<p><strong><b>Please Note-</b></strong> Other insurance companies may or may not offer the accident benefit rider.</p>
<p>Here is the calculated premium as per the data mentioned above:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Annual Premium:</strong> 49,940</li>
<li><strong>Semi-annual Premium:</strong> 25,235</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly Premium:</strong> 12,750</li>
<li><strong>Monthly Premium:</strong> 4,250</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><b>Disclaimer- </b></strong>The figures mentioned above are for illustration purpose only.</p>
<p>The aforementioned premiums are for four different types for premium intervals. Generally, annual premiums are lesser as compared to monthly, quarterly, and semi-annual options.</p>
<h2>Comparison of Various Life Insurance Plans</h2>
<h3>Term Life Insurance vs. Whole Life Insurance</h3>
<p>Term life insurance differs from whole life insurance in many ways. The insurance applicant must understand these plans carefully before opting for one. While both of these plans offer life cover, the offered benefits are different.</p>
<p>An individual's life and finances can be affected if s/he chooses the wrong plan. To avoid any kind of inconvenience in the future, one can consult a reputed insurance advisor to get a clear idea of which will plan suits his/her insurance needs.</p>

<h3>Life Insurance Plan Vs. Life Annuity Plan</h3>
<p>There is a thin line difference between a life coverage plan and a life annuity plan. In the case of policyholder's unfortunate demise, life coverage insurance provides financial protection to the policyholder's family. Whereas, the annuity plans are specifically designed to provide retirement income to the insured post-retirement.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the difference between a life coverage plan and a life annuity plan:</p>

<p><strong><b>Which one is Ideal?</b></strong></p>
<p>The best way to shortlist the right plan is by determining the purpose of the insurance purchase. If the main purpose of an individual is to provide financial protection to their dependents even in their absence, then they should consider opting for a life coverage plan. However, if they want to accumulate wealth so that they can secure their future after retirement, then they should consider opting for a life annuity plan.</p>
<p>So, according to their investment goals and requirements, the insurance buyers can opt for both the plans.</p>
<h2>Best Plan for Different Phases of Life</h2>
<p><strong><b>Best Plan for Youngsters and First-time Policy Buyers</b></strong></p>
<p>If an individual is in his/her 20's and unmarried, s/he can conveniently pick a term life coverage plan. A term plan should be the first scheme that one chooses, as the premium charged is on the lower side. This is the benefit of buying a term life insurance policy early on in your life.</p>
<p><strong><b>Best Plan for Married Individuals having Children</b></strong></p>
<p>The financial goals of an individual may change once s/he is married. After having kids, it will change drastically. An individual ought to plan their finances accordingly. Whole life coverage schemes offer the best savings along with financial safety for their future. The insured can continue with his/her existing term plan if s/he already has one, and opt for a new whole life coverage insurance plan.</p>
<p>If one does not have life coverage insurance and wishes to opt for one, s/he can opt for a combination of both the plans and divide his/her finances after consulting an insurance agent. It is good to buy a term policy and secure one's family. Also, s/he has to pay lower premiums in comparison to other life policies. This will be a better way to ensure significant financial assistance for one's future needs.</p>
<p><strong><b>Best Plan For late Beginners in their 40's</b></strong></p>
<p>If an individual has not bought any life insurance policy yet, one should choose a small term plan. They will have to pay a higher amount of premium for the same sum assured as compared to those policy buyers who are younger and have opted for a life policy in their early 20's.</p>
<h2>Group Life Insurance Policy</h2>
<p>A group life insurance policy is provided by employers, business groups, banks, and housing societies to help their employees, clients, and members.</p>
<p>In organizations, the employer retains the group life insurance policy contract and the insured employees receive a certificate of insurance coverage.</p>
<p><strong><b>Features and Benefits</b></strong></p>
<p>Here are the features and benefits of group life insurance:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Low Price- </strong>Employees have to pay a very low premium, sometimes no premium at all, to avail a group life insurance policy. Usually, the employer pays the premium for its employees.</li>
<li><strong>No Pre-Medical Tests Required- </strong>In most cases, a pre-medical check-up is not required for availing group life cover It can be a big advantage if a person is not able to avail a personal cover due to certain lifestyle habits and pre-existing health conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Easy Claim Process- </strong>For a group life insurance policy, the claim process is quite simple. The employee only needs to accept the life insurance policy from the employer and get the certificate of insurance to file the claim in future.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Saving- </strong>Both individual and group life insurance policies provide tax exemption benefits. Since the employer purchases the group policy for its employees, the tax benefits will be provided to the employer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><b>How does a Group Life Insurance Policy work?</b></strong></p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li>Usually, a group life insurance policy is more like a term life insurance policy. It implies that a fixed amount of sum assured or a life coveris provided in case the insured passes away during the policy term. Upon the maturity of the policy, no maturity benefits are provided.</li>
<li>A beneficiary can be nominated from the family who will get the death benefit in case of policyholder's demise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><b>Note- </b></strong>The sum assured is based on the individual's salary package and varies from one company to another.</p>
<h2>What is the Validity of a Group Life Insurance Policy?</h2>
<p>The coverage is provided as long as the employee is a part of the organization. When they resign or retire from the organization, they will have the option to convert the group life coverage plan into an individual plan.</p>
<p>To do so, the certificate of coverage given by the employer must be presented to the insurance provider.</p>

<h2>Everything You Need To Know About Underwriting</h2>
<p><strong><b>Definition of Underwriting</b></strong></p>
<p>In simple words, underwriting refers to the process followed by an insurance company wherein an underwriter analyzes the risk involved in insuring a particular applicant. In the evaluation process, the amount of coverage as well as payable premium is decided.</p>
<p>While underwriting a prospective customer, the underwriter aims to protect the insurer's business if the prospective customer appears to be too risky.</p>
<p>Keeping this point in mind, one should understand that if they are too risky to the insurance company, s/he may be denied life coverage insurance.</p>
<h2>Different Factors Taken into Consideration While Underwriting a Life Insurance Policy</h2>
<p>There are a lot of factors that are considered while underwriting a life insurance policy. Naturally, the first and foremost factor is the life expectancy of an applicant. If an applicant leads a healthy lifestyle, they are less susceptible to contracting/ developing diseases. Also, chances are high that they have no pre-existing illness. As they are less risky for an insurer to insure, the insurer is more likely to approve his/her application. This is because such an applicant will give the insurer a chance to balance the sum assured offered with the total premiums paid by him/her during the tenure of the life insurance policy. Below we've enlisted factors that affect life insurance policy underwriting:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Age of the Applicant: </strong>Applicant’s age shares a direct relationship with life coverage insurance premium. It means younger the applicant is, lesser the insurance premium will be. Individuals in their thirties are considered low-risk applicants. Hence, may qualify for affordable life policies with low premium rates.</li>
<li><strong>Gender of the Applicant: </strong>As per scientific research, it has been found that women have a longer life expectancy as compared to men. Since most women outlive men and pay premiums for a longer duration as compared to men, they are more likely to get an affordable life policy.</li>
<li><strong>Health History: </strong>If someone in the applicant’s family is suffering (or has suffered) from critical ailments such as cancer or heart problems, then the applicant will also be considered as a high-risk applicant. Additionally, if they have undergone some serious surgeries in the past or if they regularly fall ill, their application might be rejected by underwriters on the ground of higher risk involvement.</li>
<li><strong>Smoking Habits: </strong>If the applicant is a smoker, the premium rates for her or him can increase by 100%.</li>
<li><strong>Nature of Job: </strong>In case the applicant's job requires him/her to regularly be in a hazardous environment or situation, such as fire-fighting, mining, etc., underwriters will regard his/her case as high-risk and hence s/he may be granted the life coverage insurance policy at a very high premium rate, or in the worst-case scenario, s/he might be denied the insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, one can conclude that there are some of the factors that determine if the underwriters will approve one's application or not. Knowing these factors can help individuals assess their risk and accordingly and estimate their premium.</p>
<h2>What Should a High-Risk Applicant do?</h2>
<p>Due to many factors contributing to the approval of one's application, there is always a possibility of individuals falling into the high-risk category. Such individuals either face rejection of their application or end up paying high premiums.</p>
<p>Thankfully, plenty of life insurers specifically focus on high-risk applicants. These companies not only offer the best life policies at affordable rates but also have a wider range of experience when it comes to dealing with high-risk applicants.</p>
<h2>Life Insurance Policy for Senior Citizens</h2>
<p>To help to avoid the financial stress during their golden days, insurance companies in India have introduced various coverage policies for senior citizens, such as Whole Life Insurance, Term Insurance and Guaranteed Life Insurance. Senior citizen life insurance plans allow insurance holders to save systematically and generate the much-needed corpus to make the autumn days more contented.</p>
<p>Below are the 4 senior citizen life insurance plans offered by various insurers:</p>

<h2>Life Insurance Policy for Smokers</h2>
<p>Every smoker should have life coverage insurance, as the life expectancy of a smoker is lesser than that of a non-smoker. While smoking is not just injurious to an individual's health, it also affects one's pocket when it comes to purchasing a plan. As it may lead to premature death, insurance companies are more cautious while accepting the life coverage insurance application of smokers.</p>

<h2>Life Insurance Policy for NRIs</h2>
<p>Thanks to the increased insurance awareness, proactive financial planning has earned its due importance. The good thing is that the premium for online term plans has decreased. This has grabbed the attention of Non-Resident Indians. They are looking forward to buying life insurance plans in India. As a result, the best insurance companies have re-strategized their business model to leverage this huge potential market.</p>
<p>Term Plans offers pure life coverage and financial security. In India, most term plans can also be purchased by a Non-Resident Indian.</p>
<p><strong><b>Purpose of an NRI Life Insurance Plan</b></strong></p>
<p>For a Non-Resident Indian whose spouse, children and parents live in India, a perfect NRI plan must offer the following features:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Guaranteed Income- </strong>It must offer guaranteed income at regular intervals for the dependents.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Maximization- </strong>It must offer wealth maximization for the policyholder and his/her spouse. It will help them accomplish their financial goals.</li>
<li><strong>Children's Education- </strong>It must offer a benefit that can be used to meet the children's educational expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, few of the best life insurance plans are clubbed with a child plan to take care of the educational expenses of the insured's children. In case the policyholder passes away, his/her children get a lump sum benefit and the future insurance premium is taken care of by the insurer.</p>
<p><strong><b>Payment Mode</b></strong></p>
<p>All individuals of Indian origin, regardless of their citizenship status, are eligible to buy a life coverage plan in India. While an applicant can purchase life insurance in India from another country without any issues, additional expenses can be applicable to him/her. For NRIs, the cost of conducting medical screening and sending the reports to the insured is not covered. The premium can be paid through the following modes:</p>
<ul class="data_ul">
<li><strong>Remittal- </strong>Remittal of foreign currency.</li>
<li><strong>NRO Bank Account- </strong>For INR denominated plans issued to NRIs, NRO bank account can be used.</li>
<li><strong>NRE/ FCNR Bank Account- </strong>NRE/ FCNR bank account can be used for foreign currency-denominated plans issued to NRIs.</li>

<p><strong><b>Common Life Insurance Myths</b></strong></p>
<p>A myth is nothing but a statement that isn't backed up by facts and figures. Unfortunately, there are so many myths floating around in the insurance market that people have started believing to be true. That being said, when a policyholder buys a life insurance plan, he/she shouldn't trust any information blindly.</p>
<p>Mentioned below are some common life insurance myths. In order to enjoy the benefits of life insurance, insurance buyers must not pay any heed to these myths:</p>
<p><strong><b>Myth 1- I’m young, I don’t need to buy life insurance.</b></strong></p>
<p>Since life is unfair and unpredictable, some people die an untimely death. These days, the sedentary lifestyle youngsters are leading exposes them the risk of developing/ contracting various illnesses. When you’re young, it’s the perfect time to buy life coverage. At that time, you are less likely to develop/ contract the illness, so you can easily get life coverage insurance at a lower premium.</p>
<p><strong><b>Myth 2- My job covers me in group life </b></strong><strong><b>coverage</b></strong><strong><b> insurance, I don’t need an individual insurance plan. </b></strong></p>
<p>It is good that your employer covers you in a group life coverage plan, it is not enough. It offers basic life coverage insurance which is insufficient. Also, when you will get a better job opportunity and will switch your job, your insurance coverage would cease to exist. It isn’t guaranteed whether your new employer will offer group insurance benefit or not. You must back up your group life coverage insurance with individual insurance coverage and enjoy best of both the worlds.</p>
<p><strong><b>Myth 3 - </b></strong><strong><b>Life </b></strong><strong><b>coverage</b></strong><strong><b> insurance policy</b></strong><strong><b> won’t be useful if I die. I don’t need to buy it since I don’t have any dependent family member provide for.</b></strong></p>
<p>Going by its name, majorly people assume that life coverage insurance offers death benefit only. This statement is partially correct since life coverage insurance offers a death benefit. That being said, life coverage insurance has much more to offer above and beyond the death benefit. There are many types of life insurance plans. The death benefit is offered under a term plan. Other life policies such as unit-linked plans, endowment plans, money back plans etc. offers maturity benefit, bonuses and survival benefit on pre-decided periodicity. It helps to accomplish long and short-term goals and acts an excellent saving tool.</p>
<p><strong><b>Myth 4- </b></strong><strong><b>Best life insurance</b></strong><strong><b> comes at an expensive premium and I can’t afford it. </b></strong></p>
<p>It is high time this myth should be debunked. This myth makes people have second thoughts about opting for life coverage insurance and (unwillingly) jeopardize the financial future of their family. All you need is little effort to conduct an online search to find term plans. For insurance buyers falling in the age group of 25 years- 35 years insurance, providers offer a life cover of Rs1 1 crore under Rs. 1,000 per month only.</p>
<p><strong><b>Myth5- Buying </b></strong><strong><b>best life insurance</b></strong><strong><b> plan is a time-taking process.</b></strong></p>
<p>Not anymore. Thanks to the internet, life insurance providers have embraced technology and they have gone digital. You can easily browse through various life insurance plans on your smartphones. Buying life insurance online is easy, simple and hassle-free. All you have to do is analyze your insurance expectations, shop around, compare shortlisted plans and buy the plan that fulfills your insurance expectations. In a matter of a few seconds, you will get a digital policy in your mailbox.</p>
<p><strong><b>Myth 6- I’m covered, I have purchased a life insurance plan long back.</b></strong></p>
<p>Change is only constant. Compare your life insurance coverage with the life coverage offered by insurers these days. You’ll be taken aback to see the drastic changes in the scope of offered coverage. Additionally, the assured sum that was adequate long back, might not be adequate now. Your children must have grown up, so must have your and their expenses (thanks to inflation). You should review your insurance expectations and insurance coverage and compare what coverage you have with what you actually want.</p>
<p>If there is a gap, you can buy a life insurance plan offering adequate insurance coverage.</p>
<p><strong><b>Myth 7</b></strong><strong><b>- </b></strong><strong><b>I can’t buy multiple </b></strong><strong><b>life insurance plans</b></strong><strong><b>.</b></strong></p>
<p>You can buy various life insurance plans but you must disclose your insurance details before buying any new plan. The advantage of buying multiple life insurance plans is that if one claim gets rejected, you have other insurance plans to rely on.</p>
<p>The surefire way to not to fall into a trap set by insurance myths is to read the policy wording carefully. It will leave no room for myths to flourish. Additionally, you will be able to skim through the information and differentiate facts from myths.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of Having Multiple Life Insurance Policies</h2>
<p>Having multiple life policies has its own pros and cons. As the insurance needs vary from person to person, it is important to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of having multiple life insurance plans and then make an informed decision.</p>
<h3>Pros of Having Multiple <strong><b>Life Insurance Plans</b></strong></h3>

<h2>Reasons Why You Should Not Cancel Your Life insurance policy</h2>
<p>While it is very important for every individual to have life insurance to ensure their financial safety, there are many individuals who think that it is not important to have life insurance plans.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the reasons why one should not cancel the life insurance policy:</p>
<h3>High Life Risk Coverage</h3>
<p>One of the major advantages of opting for a life insurance policy is that it provides financial coverage to the family of the insured against covered eventualities. If a policyholder cancels their policy, they will lose the policy coverage and the financial benefits that come with the life insurance policy.</p>
<h3>Financial Assistance</h3>
<p>A life insurance plan provides financial aid at the time of eventuality. It provides financial assistance to the policy beneficiary as a lump sum payment in case of the policyholder’s demise.</p>
<h3>Better Returns</h3>
<p>As compared to the other investment options, life insurance plans offer a better return on investment. This is because few of the best life policies also include the advantage of bonuses which lacks in other options of investment.</p>
<h2>What is the Procedure for Cancelling a Life Insurance Policy?</h2>
<p>There can be a number of reasons to cancel a life insurance policy such as a financial crisis or an urgent need for money. It is fairly easy to cancel a plan. The following process is a guide to this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the official website of the life insurance provider.</li>
<li>Check the cancellation process of the life insurance policy. If you need any clarity, you can get in touch the customer support via your preferred mode.</li>
<li>Canceling a life insurance policycan leave a door open for taxes implications. To be on the safe side, you can consult a tax expert and get your tax implications linked queries solved.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><b>Note- </b></strong>If you have a whole life insurance policy, then a partial withdrawal of sum assured is allowed without complete cancellation of the policy. With a partial withdrawal, the policy will offer up a certain sum of money that you can use to address your financial needs and still enjoy insurance coverage.</p>
<h3>Cancellation Refund</h3>
<p>Every policy comes with a grace period/cool-off period which enables the policyholder to assess his/her insurance expectations. It gives him/her the time to make sure that the life insurance policy is the best for him/her. In case a policyholder cancels his/her policy during the grace period, he/she will be offered a refund. Also, she/he won't have to pay any additional fee.</p>
<h2>Impact of GST on Life Insurance</h2>
<p>The implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has influenced the prices of almost all consumer products and services. The service sector, at present, contributes to 60% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The life insurance industry is a part of the service sector that got greatly affected by the GST.</p>
<p>Life insurance was taxed between the range of 1.5% and 15% before the implementation of GST. Before the implementation of GST, the applicable rate of service tax was decided based on the type of policy. The burden of indirect taxes was passed on to the end customer; the 18% tax rate under the GST was likely to make life policies more unreachable to a larger chunk of customers, which in turn, was likely to lower the level of insurance penetration in India. Despite this, now insurance penetration has witnessed a growth of 8% (CAGR) approximately.</p>
<p>In comparison to countries like Australia, Malaysia, Africa, Singapore, etc. where the government provides the life insurance benefit as a part of social security, imposing taxes on the insurance products and services deters many people from considering buying life cover for themselves and their dependents.</p>
